<h3>Overview</h3>

The stone is moved continuously, requiring 12 hours to travel from the ceiling at noon to just above the floor at midnight.  Illustrating time, with time. I was fully responsible for the programming (C++) and ensuring the correct timing of the clock mechanism as well as developing the electronic hardware. Calibrating the stone was particularly tricky because the motor had a drift which needed to be measured and accounted for precisely.
