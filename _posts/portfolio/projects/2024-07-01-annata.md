<h3>Overview</h3>
 
Anattā is an experiment in which you are invited to be playful with your identity and that of someone else. Anattā (“non-self”) is a term from Buddhist texts and practices. This experiment for two people invites you to expand the space around the fixed self and to experience that it may not be quite as solid and stable as we often assume. How does it feel to be me?
 
How does someone who is not me feel? How does it feel when both categories dissolve?
In 2025 I modified the mirror with two time-of-flight laser sensors so visitors can use hand gestures in front of the surface to control how the two reflections merge, bringing agency and playfulness directly into the blending effect.

Experiment suggestion:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Stand with another human on each side of the mirror</li>
  <li>Position yourselves so that your faces overlap exactly</li>
  <li>steel wire</li>
  <li>Turn the dial to adjust the frequency of the light</li>
</ul>
</p>
Two-way mirror
 
The glass is coated with, or has been encased within, a thin and almost transparent layer of metal (window film usually containing aluminium). The result is a mirrored surface that reflects some light and is penetrated by the rest. Light always passes equally in both directions. However, when one side is brightly lit and the other kept dark, the darker side becomes difficult to see from the brightly lit side because it is masked by the much brighter reflection of the lit side.

<ul>
  <li>Half-transparent mirror</li>
  <li>aluminium frame</li>
  <li>3D printed parts</li>
  <li>microcontroller & knob & led stripe</li>
</ul>
