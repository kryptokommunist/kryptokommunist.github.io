The Curium project was designed around the development of 6U CubeSats, using components primarily sourced from commercial manufacturers. We utilized a launch opportunity from the <a href="https://www.dlr.de/en/latest/news/2022/02/20220620_go-ahead-for-second-round-of-microlauncher-payload-competition" rel="nofollow">DLR microlauncher competition 2022</a>. I was part of the on board computer (OBC) team. Part of the code is publicly accessible on <a href="https://github.com/Curium-Five">github</a>.
