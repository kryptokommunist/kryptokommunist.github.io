Hi,

I'm looking for someone to swap flats with in Berlin.  
Here are some details and photos of my place. I'd like to swap for a place > 40 sqm near Tempelhof or in Steglitz/Schöneberg with maximum 600 Euro Warmmiete. Not opposed to other areas if they are quiet and near those I mentioned. I have a WBS up to 50 sqm.

## Key facts

- 5 minutes walking from **Frankfurter Tor** (U5 / U-Bahn)
- **Warmmiete:** 1.588 €
- **Big: 4 rooms, 103 sqm!**
