Hi,

I'm looking for someone to swap flats with in Berlin.  
Here are some details and photos of my place. I'd like to swap for a place > 40 sqm near Tempelhof or in Steglitz/Schöneberg with maximum 600 Euro Warmmiete. Not opposed to other areas if they are quiet and near those I mentioned. I have a WBS up to 50 sqm.
