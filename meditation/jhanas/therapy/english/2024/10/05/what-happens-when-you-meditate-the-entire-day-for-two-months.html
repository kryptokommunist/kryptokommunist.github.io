<h2 id="what-are-emotions">what are emotions?</h2>

<p>I practiced a Rob Burbea retreat on emotions for a couple of days at the end of the retreat: <a href="https://dharmaseed.org/retreats/1466/">The boundless heart</a>. From that, I got a sense of looking at the emotional body, the axis from the perineum to the top of the head. When I checked in the sensations, I could feel how what I consider emotions is mapped onto that. For example, shame is tension in the lower belly; fear lives in tension in the belly and throat and shoulders, love and spaciousness live as warmth and softness in the heart. Also, most of the time it was impossible for me to name the emotion, the combination of tensions and sensations was so unique in each moment of experience. From Rob, I got the idea that it’s okay that in practice there doesn’t have to be a cathartic release. And it pointed me to our nature beyond conceptual ideas. Looking at the emotional body there were so many different states that shift constantly that it was clear that I am not a conceptual thing. I can’t grasp myself using words, concepts or the mind.</p>

<p>Additionally, listening to the retreat recordings taught me to feel the tensions in the body and imagine a soft white bubble of spaciousness around them. This really helped to feel the unpleasant tensions that were present. And I played with a suggestion of Rob to imagine the world as sacred. Indeed after a day of holding that idea lightly everything around me felt like something more meaningful and sacred. It was subtle but clear how much ideas and views shape perception. Also from that recording I played with just expressing limited beliefs verbally and repeating them, e.g. “I need to be a good boy”. After a while of doing that, I laughed and the belief just released. I loved Rob’s input which always included a sense that everything is just a view and there is no solid meditation approach, you don’t need to twist yourself into pretzelshape to meditate. That helped me to let go of this archetype of what meditation and awakening look like for me. Rob also mentioned that there is no way around the fact that the Buddha in the Pali canon proposes a kind of aloofness and transcendence of the humanness and world. I always struggled with a sense of that and it was encouraging to hear from Rob that he finds that practice can go together with engagement and longing that is part of our human form.</p>

<h3 id="emotional-release">emotional release</h3>

<p>At the retreat we did breathwork every morning. Screaming and kicking was a great way to release anger. At some point, I put up a boxing sack in a little hut. I could really notice that whenever I felt depressed and stuck and I went punching the bag I would feel more whole and loving afterwards. It really helped me to meet and love anger. I could sense when after tapping into anger fear would rise to block it. But I slowly went deeper and deeper. At some point, I was surprised how hard I could kick when I really allowed the anger. I realized that I normally have my handbrakes on my own strength, perceiving myself as much weaker because of my resistance to feeling anger. After the first month of practice, I was able to tap into anger and fear like never before in my life. I made it a habit to spend one to two hours every day to feel into anger and fear. Singing, laughing, punching, jumping. Sometimes it would have looked like me being crazy from the outside when I was actually just processing my emotions.</p>

<p>Normally, in society, controlling your emotions is the norm, feeling them and expressing them fully is considered crazy, except if you’re an actor. I would go on walks sometimes just singing and laughing by myself, after weeks of retreat practice, I lost my sense of fear of being judged. One night, when I was laughing, it triggered one of the neighbors who came on his ATV towards me and, with huge anger, told me to stay away from his property and that he would call the police on me otherwise. Also, he had a dead pig on the back of his vehicle. Probably, he was just scared and triggered by me expressing my emotions more fully. Here, I could really notice the effect of the practice. Normally I would have been triggered by this. But after all my anger release work I could stay calm and spacious and I tried to communicate that I was on a mediation retreat and that I would respect his property. As he drove off I couldn’t help but continue laughing.</p>

<p class="caption">The punching bag after a very freeing anger release session. I didn't expect how much strength there is in my body.</p>

<h2 id="weeks-of-internal-family-systems">weeks of Internal Family Systems</h2>

<p>For the first three weeks, I heavily practiced <a href="https://ifs-institute.com">internal family systems</a>. It’s a therapy modality that has helped me tremendously. The main idea is that our minds are not a monolithic entity, but a plural system of parts. It helps in relating to parts and experiences differently, with acceptance and love. During this time I encountered so many parts that had strange worldviews and beliefs that I was never aware of before. Patiently I again and again reminded so many parts that I am an adult and that I do not live with my parents anymore. Also, I learned to communicate and befriend parts of myself. I asked parts questions and offered them to be friends and to work together. This was really noticeable after three weeks. I would look into the mirror and the voice in my head would say “You look great, I love you”. I would drop something and the voice would say “No worries, I love you”. That was so amazing that I could rewire my inner dialogue that way. Then there were experiences of talking to parts leading to my entire body tingling. My sense of the work was that IFS is similar to practicing metta (loving-kindness). The verbal component helps the mind to have a little bit of an illusion of control, which eased me into letting go. Talking from the IFS Self felt similar to generating metta, while the voice would talk, tensions in the body would unwind and soften.</p>

<h2 id="deconstructing-myself-and-jhana-practice">deconstructing myself and jhana practice</h2>

<p>My main practice was metta practice. Since accessing jhana four in my <a href="/meditation/jhanas/therapy/english/2024/01/01/what-i-learned-about-meditation-love-and-trauma-on-and-after-a-twim-retreat-with-delson-armstrong.html">last retreat</a> I wanted to continue and progress. So I kept radiating metta from my head in six directions. At some point I was doing that throughout the day. I did not progress into other Jhanas, unfortunately. Still staying in the fourth Jhana set forth some processes. I felt that with time passing on, my body felt thinner and lighter, more nebulous. That seemed to be correlated with my sense of self feeling very thin as well. At some point, my visual field started flickering all the time when I closed my eyes or after a longer sitting. I could glimpse that I was seeing frames of experience and how the flickering correlated with the muscles around my eyes tensing slightly. I could sense that the tension around the eyes would come every time a sense of self was created. And this all also correlated with any shift of tensions in the body, the body would take a slightly new shape and I could intuit that that constituted a new sense of self.</p>

<p>At some point, I had the insight that does sound obvious but felt very freeing to me that I am living in the present and that each self is created in the present, and that I felt free from my past. I had a sense that my sense of self was unraveling faster and faster. I remember that in one meditation I went through my whole life chronologically and at some point realized that in all the images I couldn’t find myself, I was not in my memories. Somehow that also felt deeply freeing.</p>

<h2 id="changes-in-awareness">changes in awareness</h2>

<p>I could feel my awareness becoming wider after a couple of weeks. For example, I could look at a cornfield with a wide awareness and I could see the waves of the wind on the entire cornfield at the same time rather than only seeing a part of it. The first time I noticed it, it felt psychedelic. Also later after the retreat how the ocean looked changed. Seeing wave patterns with wide awareness is so fascinatingly beautiful.</p>

<p>Another thing that stood out was that I could remember most of my dreams. And after a couple of weeks due to my metta practice a golden heart would start appearing again and again in my dreams.</p>

<h2 id="narcissism-in-meditation-teachers-and-the-guru-pattern">narcissism in meditation teachers and the guru pattern</h2>

<p>I was clear that I needed to properly vet the teacher since the retreat in silence for two months meant that my only external input would be the teacher since we would vow to not read, write, or communicate with anyone outside the retreat. The teacher was very welcoming and accommodating, it felt like he gave a lot of space and was sensitive to my special needs and concerns due to undertaking this long retreat knowing I have a lot of childhood trauma to work with.</p>

<p>But the longer the retreat progressed it felt to me, the more controlling and grandiose the teacher became. At times I felt it was more important to him to be seen as a great teacher and get validation from his students. So much so, that it interfered with building a trusting student teacher relationship. For the time I was there the teacher did not allow question during dharma talks. Also, there was some controlling behavior (e.g. lashing out at somebody being sad or somebody being late). For example even though the teacher verbally welcomed students crying emotionally it felt like crying made him uncomfortable which probably made it harder to process grief I had. Sometimes I felt what he was talking about was in contradiction with his actions. Considering he had 15 years of intensive practice in monasteries under his belt and had deep awakening experiences, it made clear to me that awakening and meditation practice would not solve all my problems as I had hoped. So from this, I realized that I want to give relational practice and trauma therapy a higher priority in my life.</p>

<p>With more time passing I found myself getting more and more angry at the teacher and my thoughts revolving mainly around the teacher. I have not had such an experience on my other retreats. After describing the situation to my therapist she suggested: “oh seems like narcissism”. That was such a huge relief to have a word for what was so confusing. I noticed that just sitting in front of the teacher would shift sensations in my stomach, maybe because of the concentration practice and spaciousness through his practice, emotions such as anger would be transmitted in a way that is very hard to notice. It felt like there was anger packaged in spaciousness, so that my mind wouldn’t catch it but my body reacted and it felt like watching a reality distortion field at work. My sense was that the Guru phenomenon might work like this. Somebody with very high concentration powers transmits his reality just through presence without even talking, sidestepping the mind. With enough concentration or awareness, you can overwrite somebodies else’s body sensations if they have less concentration powers and they won’t even notice for a while. You don’t need to be louder or openly aggressive, just by having more concentration you can bend social reality around you. While the student is questioning his feelings of confusion the guru has already repeated his reality through concentration abilities a hundred times and will overwrite the student’s body sensations just through presence.</p>

<p>While these issues were major I also felt that the teacher was genuinely trying his best and he did also had a truly loving and accepting side that I have not come across in many people. He had a sensitivity and ability to say the right thing in tense situations, which really helped me to accept myself. So I was able to work with his sides that were troubling to me to work out certain woundings from my childhood. I was able to see my own narcissism and how that was the prerequisite to falling for others’ narcissism. I could only believe other grandiose parts when I took my own grandiosity too seriously. When I could laugh about my own parts thinking they were better than everybody else I could also laugh when I saw those parts in the teacher. Now, three month later I can tell that despite all these troubling aspects the teacher was safe enough for me to work out issues I had with my parents a bit.</p>

<h2 id="dissociative-identity-disorder-long-retreat-and-heavy-practice">Dissociative Identity Disorder, long retreat and heavy practice</h2>

<p>Just the month before starting the retreat I have started to internalize that I have Dissociative Identity Disorder. That means having different altars/personalities that take over. This leads to some confusions in everyday life because these selves sometimes don’t share memories very well or at all. This explained my changing perception of time. My life used to feel like a movie with many fast cuts, it was chaotic and disorienting. About two years ago after heavy practice and developing the witness my life started feeling like a continuous movie.</p>

<p>On retreat, I got to know different selves and their purposes. I mainly noticed it as different voices in my head at first. I would ask them for their names and ages. I had the astonishing experience of first time intuitively noticing co-consciousness, I was aware that another self was leading my body. But I could talk to that self and also I could intervene whenever I wanted. Then another mindboggling experience was when I realized a switch between altars in hindsight. I sat down to meditate and started interacting with a very friendly voice, then the realization hit me that yesterday I was that voice I was talking to now. But now I identified with a different voice. This all gave me a lot of self-trust. While the selves and identity were changing, awareness stayed awake throughout. To be honest before it was a little terrifying to realize that my current self could disappear and I don’t know when or if it (I) would come back. Kinda like sleeping only without a choice about when or how long. That experience showed me that awareness remains and safety lies in resting in awareness.</p>

<h2 id="sexual-trauma-coming-up-on-retreat">sexual trauma coming up on retreat</h2>

<p>One of the reasons I wanted to go on this retreat was to work with sexual trauma from my childhood. Unfortunately, because of the mentioned issues with the teacher, I did not feel comfortable sharing what was going on for me in that regard with him. Still, I had some healing experiences. One thing I noticed in the first week was that just sitting still for this long can be a trigger in itself, reminding the body of freeze and helplessness. So I introduced movement in my practice with a focus on power stances. E.g. putting fists on the legs, pushing out the arms outwards, moving the head around before each sit or during.</p>

<p>Then as with time after a couple weeks sexual feelings would come up during sits. It was related to awareness coming into my perineum. I realized that I haven’t breathed fully and deeply before because doing so will make attention travel to the perineum at the end of an in-breath. Now the talk of the root chakra as the source of life energy made sense to me. I was likely cut off from it due to it triggering body memories of sexual experiences and trauma. So I spent a few sits just sitting with the feelings, working through many memories of past sexual partners.</p>

<p>After a while, I also noticed that before going to sleep I would feel fear in my stomach and sensation in my perineum. I realized that my sleeping issues for my whole life must have come from my body replaying sexual trauma memories before going to bed. At this point of the retreat, I could bring up metta to accept these sensations. And yoga nidra was very helpful. With time the sensations became less scary, the fear of them was worse than the sensations themselves. But to me, it really brought home the message that the body keeps the score. Hundreds of nights spent on Youtube or other procrastinations to escape these sensations without me even being aware that this was driving my behaviour. With more time I could go to sleep more easily.</p>

<p>And I found a few parts in myself that had quite strange and extreme beliefs due to the sexual trauma. E.g. I found a part that thought it was my perpetrator and during a sit, I found traumatic imagery where the perspective was such as if I had abused myself. A lot of shame was tied to that. Generally, there were a lot of parts that hated me and it was quite a journey working with them. First I tried to befriend them, but even after weeks, they kept saying abusive things. So then I set boundaries with them “You can’t talk to me like that. We can talk if you are more friendly.”. That and teaching other parts or altars that were targets to hold boundaries helped. I kept repeating that it was not my or any parts fault throughout the entire retreat.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>

<p>The retreat was such a valuable experience for me. It gave me more trust in my awareness and that I will be okay. I could see how fear most of the time is worse than whatever I was afraid of. Also, it taught me gentleness, slowly accepting, and being with experience. From this, I also realized the importance of the body and that radiating metta from my head would lead to some kind of transcendence of my humanity. Even though it feels nice, being with my body, chakras and emotions is key for humaning with more ease. Fortunately, I was blessed to be able to spend a month at Esalen right after, where I learned the value of body work and relational awareness practices for healing and being.</p>
