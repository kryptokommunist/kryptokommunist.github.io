        "title": "Creating a FreeCAD 3D view inside Jupyter Notebooks - GSoC 2020",
        "author": "",
        "category": "[&quot;tech&quot;]",
        "content": "Accidentally while creating a lamp I ended up learning FreeCAD. FreeCAD is an amazing open source CAD program. It still amazes me that people created this for free in their spare time. The software is still in it’s alpha version and is far from perfect as you can tell by the current release version number 0.19 and the heated discussions around how soon a 1.0 release could be reached. Still it’s very usable and once you get the gist of it you can create powerful and complex designs. FreeCADs approach to CAD is a parametric design. That means that you specify shapes with parameters. E.g. you base the 3D shape on a 2D drawing. The geometric figures of the 2D drawing - circles, recatangles, lines - are all constrained with parameters. Then you create a 3D shape out of your 2D sketch, for example by extruding it. And every step is based on certain parameters that can reference previous parameters. It’s basically visual programming. Is FreeCAD NP-complete? Probably, but that’s a topic for another time. Anyways. The parametric approach allows you to easily modify your design at any time just by tuning these parameters. For example with my lamp design the number of aluminium bars is a parameter I can simply tweak at any point in time. All the relevant details depending on this number will be automatically recomputed by FreeCAD. This gives great flexibility and allows for fast customization.Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is program run by Google that gives stipends to students who over a period of three months implement an open source project with a mentor organization. Among the organizations are well known ones like Arduino, Ruby or Wikimedia. But there are also more niche organizations that are not so widely known. The great part about GSoC is that students apply for specific projects, so you yourself determine how exciting the thing you work on is if you get accepted. This and the work from home aspects are definitely something a lot of internships can’t offer. For me it started with seeing the potential of first designing a parametric lamp and then creating a custom web page where you could change the parameters to your liking and see a live 3D rendering of the changed lamp. Then you just download the 3D files and 3D-print the lamp. I was heavily inspired by the card1o cover generator created with OpenSCAD. After some research I realized that something comparable to rendering OpenSCAD in the web browser does not exist for FreeCAD yet. I already knew about GSoC and to my suprise FreeCAD was one of the open source organizations taking part in GSoC 2020.The result from printing the cover generator customized card1o badge cover. It's such a cool experience to customize something so effortlessly and to then have it in your hands. Unlike designing everything you don't have to think a about it too much, but you still feel more connected to the end product since it has a personal touch. That's the experience I wanted to create for my lamp design.I sent out two applications: A better IPython and Jupyter Notebook Integration for FreeCAD and Measurement tool for FreeCAD. In the end the first one was chosen. It was closer to my original idea that got me excited and on the path of applying. I definitely didn’t expect the application to succeed, but that might just be the classic imposter syndrome. I put in quite some thought researching the topic and contacted some of the previous students, I even managed to email the student who applied for the exact same idea a couple years before. He was so nice to send me a link to his old application so that I could make us of the feedback he got on his application from back then. After the acceptance the project started moving. The FreeCAD community is mainly organized in an old school internet forum. I haven’t used one since I was active on an RC car forum when I was 14 before I signed up on forum.freecadweb.org. Here is the project thread where I posted questions and updates on work progress: link. For the unlikely case that you haven’t read through my 8 page project application let me summarize it for you. Or actually the document is very well written so let me quote it instead:  Currently, FreeCAD’s IPython and Jupyter Notebook integration can only provide visualization by running the entire FreeCAD GUI alongside the notebook. Besides not being elegant it brings many problems with it, like not being able to save the visualizations inside the notebook for sharing or bringing visual complexity of the entire GUI into the view instead of just displaying the 3D model. It is therefore important to find a way to visualize FreeCAD’s 3D scene in the IPython display system as supported by Jupyter Notebook.  Tackling the open issue “IPython / Jupyter support” I aim to implement a IPython compatible visualization of FreeCAD’s 3D Open Inventor scene graph. To achieve this I intend to choose a suitable JavaScript library able to render a 3D scene graph and to implement a mapping between it and the Open Inventor scene graph. After this as a byproduct I want to implement a better WebGL export based on the scene graph instead of document objects as currently found in FreeCAD. For this I can reuse and integrate the scene graph mapping component. Lastly I want to document the results in the Wiki and create an example Jupyter notebook.To make things a bit more clear, Juypter Notebook is an multi purpose computation evironment, which basically means you can run interactive code on the web. Since Juypter Notebook and FreeCAD both support Python this is a match made in heaven. With Jupyter you can quickly create interactive UIs and mix them with text into a great experience for learning, communicating and experimenting. Opening this space to FreeCAD users and developers brings potentially endless new possibilities. You get access to all the powerful Jupyter widgets that make it so popular. I certainly hope some of you reading this will take this idea further by writing that interactive Python scripting tutorial inside a notebook, by writing that new workbench which will have a widget for notebooks, by improving your workbenches Python API so you can easily access all GUI functions inside a notebook.\"The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\" (Quote and image from juypter.org)It's not much, but it's honest work. This project demo shows the benefits of using the Jupyter Notebook environment. You can quickly code an interactive UI that creates objects in a FreeCAD document and removes them again. Also you can see that the viewer will tell you the index of faces and edges. This is important if you want to script FreeCAD entirely in a notebook.Here is an example Jupyter Notebook that uses the freecadviewer Python module I created during the GSoC. Be aware that due to the missing Python kernel (this is just a static site) most of the interactivity is lost. For full interactivity you should run the notebook yourself. The link to the full static notebook is here. But still you can pan and zoom the 3D views inside the notebook:As you probably already have guessed, this enables you to embed interactive FreeCAD views on your web sites, e.g. like this:You get this cool feature almost for free thanks to Jupyter and without touching any Javascript. I created an example notebook to illustrate the process and potential. The link to the full static notebook is here:But enough with the “Why” let’s get to the “How” aka technical details shall we? Since the goal is to have a very general 3D viewer solution that will be able to display any content that exists inside the desktop applications 3D view we need to work directly with it’s scene graph. So how does FreeCAD generate it’s 3D view? Internally FreeCAD relies on a C++ CAD library called Open Cascade that implements 2D and 3D geometric modelling. You could say Open Cascade is FreeCADs CAD kernel. Internally Open Cascade represents Geometries mathematically in potentially infinite resulution. The visualization on the other hand is realized with a probably not that widely know framework called Coin3D which itself is based on a format called Open Inventor:  Coin is an OpenGL-based, 3D graphics library that has its roots in the Open Inventor 2.1 API, which Coin still is compatible with.  If you are not familiar with Open Inventor, it is a scene-graph based, retain-mode, rendering and model manipulation, C++ class library, originally designed by SGI. It quickly became the de facto standard graphics library for 3D visualization and visual simulation software in the scientific and engineering community after its release. It also became the basis for the VRML1 file format standard. Several books exists on the subject of Open Inventor, most notably The Inventor Mentor, and The Inventor Toolmaker, both highly recommended for those who wants to learn how to use Open Inventor.Thankfully someone started creating a Python binding for the Coin3D library as a topic for his masterthesis. It still lives on under the name pivy. This means that I possibly can implement the project entirely in Python. Which has been a very pleasent language to work with so far.Based on this the plan was to extract the objects from the Coin3D scene graph and to then translate and represent them within a WebGL based library that can be used inside a Jupyter notebook. This meant I might have to touch JavaScript which is not a beauty to work with. After some deliberations I chose pythreejs which is a Jupyter Notebook extension that integrates the infamous ThreeJS with a Python bridge. That meant less JavaScript and a smooth integration into the Jupyter Notebook environment. My previous experiments with directly inserting the ThreeJS JavaScript library all failed horribly. Additionally this means that FreeCAD users and developers already familiar with scripting in Python can modify the Jupyter 3D view themselves with a minimal learning curve.In the end the task was not extremely complex. All I needed to do was to extract faces and edges from the Coin3D scene graph and then reassemble it in a slightly modified structure inside pythreejs. The fundamental structure between both 3D libraries is similar enough that I can represent Coin3D in ThreeJS without major changes. What still made this project a challenge was starting from zero knowledge about FreeCADs internals and computer graphics. Additionally some bugs alsways make their way into the project and finding and solving them can take a lot of time. Especially the notebook environment was new for me and made some aspects more complicated. For examples you now also have to take a look at the Javascript console in the browser from time to time to diagnose a problem. Also coordination and communication with many stake holder slows down the progress and it can be especially frustrating if you think you found a bug and then the project is not maintained regularly and you have to watch your issues die silently on Github. Overall it’s still a great experience to work so autonomously on for an open source project that is used by so many people. So I hope there will be some people interested in using FreeCAD inside Jupyter Notebook as well out there.I will continue to improve the project in the future. You can find the repository here. If you use the module and encounter any issues or just find it useful, don’t hesitate to post to the forum thread or let me know with a tweet or an issue in the repository.Thanks to my mentors: @ickby, @kkremitzki, @yorik. I’m grateful for them spending time on helping me with the project. Doing this entirely in their spare time is insanely great! Also thanks to the entire FreeCAD community who gave helpful input. I was especially impressed by how much effort @vocx-fc put into reviewing my second pull request to FreeCAD. So this GSoC, also by watching what my fellow students where doing, definitely taught me to appreciate free software and open source even more. ❤️",

        "category": "[&quot;startup&quot;, &quot;english&quot;]",
        "content": "This year and last year I was lucky to be part of the HPI Startup Bootcamp. To my suprise my team won the first time I took part (link or it didn’t happen) and last year at least got a spontaneous made up prize because the jury liked the idea so much (can I has link plz). But enough humble or not so humble brags. I wanted to condense what I have learned there into a text hopefully giving you guidance on whether to attend and what to expect at such an event aside from late Roman, decadent catering. The learnings are a combination of the practical bootcamp experiences as well as the accompanying lecture called IT-Entrepreneurship.Lots of people and obligatory branded T-shirts. (image: HPI / Kay Herschelmann)Practical Experience from SpeakersThe most inspiring and motivating aspect is the wide array of guest speakers that speak about their own failures and success on the startup journey. The key take away from that for myself was that they were just normal people that just did stuff and never stopped trying. Some founded over a dozen companies that eventually failed before becoming part of the winning team. Also people founded companies early in their life but some even started at 40 and succeeded.Also many admitted that luck played a big part in the ultimate success. They hit a right trend, a growing market segment, some unlucky competitor went bankrupt or a huge company just somehow never bothered to develop a competing product. And clearly there were some that had a very noble mission and they were clearly striving to make the world better with their product and companies while others were more driven by success and more control over company culture than the actual product and it’s impact in the world.Also talking to people from the Venture Capital world was interesting a guy that about every four sentences was saying “You need to ask where’s the money!” comes to mind. Also tales of how complicated regulatory rules for creating medical devices in Germany are were part of the learnings.TeamThis is how a team could look like. (image: HPI / Kay Herschelmann)The founding team for a startup is essential for its survival. Since resources are scarce in the beginning the team will have to put up with a lot of pressure and needs to solve hard problems in a fast changing environment. The ideal size for a founding team is two to three people. Due to lack of resources and the necessity of fast execution the team members should know each other well so they can judge if they trust each other to manage to deliver in a startup setting. Furthermore the team should consist of smart and driven people, mediocre teams won’t build a great company. A complementary skill set also makes a good team, so there’s someone that is good at marketing and business, design and UX as well as someone comfortable with engineering and developing (Along the lines of Hipster, Hacker, Hustler).The ideal team for my startup would consist of one person with a business background who also has a very good understanding of the technology or sector the idea focuses on. This person should be able to understand and communicate complex ideas to a non-technical audience and have excellent people skills. Further the team should have a person that is highly technically competent. Additionally one person on the team should have competency in building front-end applications and graphics programming. All of these people would ideally already know each other for a while and be self-motivated and believing in the company’s mission.Startup IdeaThere are two idea generation methods for startup ideas: Problem Identification and Technology Push. Technology Push describes the process of pushing a new or existing technology out into the market for a use-case that currently is not addressed by the technology. Problem Identification on the other hand describes the reversed process of first identifying a problem by market research and observing users and then building a solution to the identified problem. Using your own problems is generally not recommended since you might be biased and the needs and requirements of yourself don’t have to reflect the needs and requirements of the market.For my startup idea I used the Technology Push approach. This was due to my own interest in the field of audio processing and having some technical experience within it. I did some cursory research and saw that there was no existing commercial audification player. Therefore my reasoning was, that this might be an idea that is not too obvious but at the same time possibly very useful to some use-cases. Even though the idea was inspired by Rolls-Royce’s bootcamp challenge, the hope is that this technology has a broader market beyond just addressing this particular problem. Therefore I’d categorize it as Technology Push.Leap of Faith HypothesesWith every new startup there are new ideas and leap of faith hypotheses. These are assumptions that you implicitly assume to be true without having actually tested them. For example with the iPod there was the implicit assumption that most people would pay for digital music. Making these hypotheses explicit and methodically testing them will help you steer your startup into the right direction and avoid suffering from confirmation biases. It makes sense to differentiate between two kinds of leap of faith hypothesis: value and growth hypothesis. The value hypothesis concern the value provided to users by your product while growth hypothesis refer to growth assumptions. For my startup idea from the 2019 bootcamp these hypotheses were:The idea was audification of data streams in order to enable human data analysts to intuitively grasp what's going on in multidimensional data sets. Since you can process parallel sounds much more efficiently than multiple visual graphs.InterviewsIn order to ground your product in reality and to reach customer and market fit it is beneficial to get external input through customer interviews. The main goal is to identify your specific customers needs, beware of the fact that what a customer says she wants and the actual need she has might not be related. The fundamentals of the customer interview are to stick and develop an interview script beforehand. Further you should ask for sufficient time. Lastly it is vital to immediately afterwards document the interview. The interviews should get you feedback for different phases of your startup. First in your beginning and ideation phase the Problem Interview will help you to get a clearer picture of the problem and environment you chose. Next when you build a demo to address your problem a Solution Interview will help you get feedback before starting to build the actual problem. And finally when you build your first product, your MVP, the MVP Interview you should test your messaging, pricing and activation flow.Business ModelsThree common business models are: Direct Business Model, Multisided Business Model and Marketplaces. A Direct Business Model advertises and sells directly to the user who pays for the product as its user. Different from that is a Multisided Business Model, where the main users of a product pay indirectly, non monetarily while the monetization happens through another party paying for a derivative asset of the product, e.g. Facebook’s monetization of its users through selling ads. Slightly similar is the Marketplace Business Model where buyers and sellers are matched through your product and the value exchange between them is direct unlike in advertising.Lean Startup ApproachThe Build-Measure-Learn Cycle concept sees the startup as a machine that turns ideas into products and adapts quickly to learned lessons in order to create a successful product. This process can be seen as an iterative cycle with six stages: Ideas, Build, Product, Measure, Data, Learn. With each Iteration of the process new learnings arise that will steer the decisions of the startup. This concept is similar to the Agile process or Design Thinking process with fast feedback and prototyping iterations.Offering and Minimal-Viable-Product (MVP)In order to validate the Problem-Solution-Fit you can use an offering. The offering is a test used to measure not what users say, but what they actually do. It consists of an Unique Value Proposition, Demo and Pricing. The Unique Value Proposition (UVP) is a promise about your solution to the customers. The Demo is an narrative that takes your UVP and helps potential customers visualize and grasp it. The Pricing is an call to action that might even require an actual payment.An MVP is a product comprised out of the minimum set of features in order to learn from early adopters. The goal is to enable fast iterations and early customer feedback to avoid building something that nobody wants. The difference to an offering is that an offering is not an actual product but a carefully scripted narrative about the product and not an functional product. The MVP on the other hand is a functional product.An MVP for my startup would be an application that can load CSV files from disk and output an audification whilst simultaneously showing the graphs so you can verify and understand that you are actually hearing the data characteristics.Business Model EnvironmentThe key forces influencing the business model are: Key Trends, Market Forces, Macro Economic Forces and Industry Forces. Key Trends are general trends in various fields, they can be regulatory, societal, technological and more. Market Forces are issues, needs and demands, segments of your market and similar items. Macro Economic Forces relate to global economy, it’s infrastructure, commodity resources etc.. Industry Forces consist of your competitors, your supply chain, substitute products and other examples.Startup Marketing - AARRR MetricsAARRR Metrics are an acronym referring to Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral and Revenue. Acquisition Metrics are all related to where the users of the product are coming from what channels, what costs etc.. Activation Metrics are about the first experience the user has with the product, at what point do you gain users to permanently use you product and show them the worth of it. Retention Metrics measure what customers you are loosing and the reasons for that. Referral Metrics measure why and how users become advocates for your product. Revenue Metrics measure Customer Lifetime Value, Customer Acquisition Cost and other revenue related metrics.TL;DR: Startup bootcamps can be fun and you learn some things that prepare you for the real thing, but you still have to go out and just start moving!",

        "content": "I love travelling, every now and then I have the privilege to be able to travel abroad for a longer period. In my case that usually has been about a month. And things go horribly wrong. On the one hand it means I learn something on the other hand it means things like burning 700 Euros for no other reason than being utterly stupid. Therefore I compiled this compact post about how to do things right from the beginning.Do you even prepare bro?Preparing a trip is something I’d rather avoid doing, it’s just not any fun. I once was asked by a guy on the street if he could crash my couch. As it turned out he was travelling without anything. No money, no plan, not even a backpack. He was basically homeless, just with a drive to explore the world, which made all the difference. All he had was his T-shirt, pants, shoes and most importantly: His willingness to leave his comfort zone. He’d been doing it for years successfully. So of course I’d let him crash my couch. But since me and you aren’t that badass, unlike this inspiring fella, we need some preparation before taking off. Still he is living proof, how far you can get with literally nothing. So next time you get anxious about something, think of the guy that by default arrives with prospects of sleeping under the bridge but still manages to find a home to sleep (admittedly not always) and to enjoy his travels.Booking flightsJust don’t be a no-show for your outbound flight assuming you can just book a later one separately. Most airlines cheapest tickets don’t allow this and your return trip gets automatically cancelled. As a result I burned 700 Euros for buying new plane tickets. Therefore always check with the airline about cancellation/rebooking and no-show conditions because plane tickets are not sensible. Also make sure that you have check-in luggage included if you have multi destination flights. Consider buying that slightly more expensive ticket with a cancellation option if you aren’t one hundred percent sure about the travel date.Preparing for the worst case before your tripWhat are the bad things that can happen to you while travelling. Things where you’d go: “I’m so fucked! I’m so fucked! God, I am so fucked!”. You could get robbed, you could end up in a situation where every store is already closed and you’re starving. You could loose all your cash, you could loose your credit card. All these scenarios can reasonably happen and some I experienced myself. Therefore it is smart to prepare beforehand to at least mitigate some of the fallback of getting yourself in a messy situation.  Bring a food ration that’s enough for 3 days, I highly recommend very compact powder food, e.g. Jimmy Joy. Tastes good and can really save your ass.  Bring enough cash to survive for 3 days, even if it’s just in your own currency. You can change it at an money exchange.  Get information on how to report a lost credit card to your bank. If you know the phone number: If you can’t call them how can you do it with just internet?  Find out what options you have if you lost your credit card. Does your bank provide you emergency cash and credit card? If not you should switch your bank. I can fully recommend DKB-Visa.  Get a VoIP-number so you can make cheap phone calls to your bank or travel-insurance or other important institutions at your home country without going bankrupt. I recommend Satellite, you’ll get 100 minutes for free!  Make sure you have a travel insurance and that they cover the country your visiting. If not it’s no more than 10 Euros a year so you don’t have to worry about getting sick or injured abroad.  Check if you should get special vaccinations for your destination. Sometimes your regular insurance will cover the costs.  To prevent getting lost if you need to catch the last bus or to return your rented snow board gear, make sure to have offline maps and enough battery or as a backup a paper map.My breakfast, lunch and dinner after loosing my credit card.I lost my credit card before arriving in Tokyo. This was all the cash I had arriving at my hotel. All in all it was just enough to buy tickets from the airport to the hotel and the next Western Union branch next day after organizing emergency cash. I could not even afford a bottle of water.Emergency cash provided by Visa same day after calling them over VoIP.Emergency credit card provided by Visa two days after calling them, it was directly sent to my hotel.Keeping things so you can quickly access themPacking my bag inevitably led to chaos. Imagine the following scenario: Your on the train, you need to look up your next connection. Your phones battery is close to dying a painless but consequential death. You open your backpack and you hectically sort through the clutter. You’re getting stressed, your body emits stress hormones and as a result you die 5 years earlier than without this stress.Here is the solution, use see-through bags you can get on Amazon. I sort everything in categories. E.g. important travel documents (passport, plane tickets), hygiene, plane utensils (sleeping mask, ear plugs) etc. This way you can quick access everything you need in seconds. It costs some preparation time to think of useful categories for the trip and sorting everything, but you will access any item in a matter of seconds without thinking.With the bags I could easily access everything, here you can see my medication and my computer accessory bag.There's even a bag for more bags. Just in case.Be ready for exploringObviously you don’t want to carry around a giant backpack all the time, therefore just bring a smaller daypack with you. Make sure that it will neatly fit in your backpack, just like the sweet Russian Matryoshka dolls. If I board a plane I will keep the daypack separately with some items like laptop and e-reader. If I know I’ll have to transfer a lot, for example a bus ride and a connecting train afterwards, I’ll put everything inside the big backpack to ensure that I’ll only have to worry about one bag and I’ll have both hands free anytime.I proudly present: BagpackceptionBackpack protectionFor backpacks that you want to check-in just buy a backpack protection. A very simple one from Tatonka I can recommend is this one. It’s very cheap, just eight Euros, and effective. This simple plastic bag is very sturdy and kept my backpack protected on five flights without any signs of deterioration. You should keep zip ties with you because the attached rope to tie the bag isn’t sufficient at all.At the airport it takes no more than two minutes to put your backpack inside the cover.And correctly ziptied at the top even this very cheap protection cover does it's job well.Boarding like a proPersonally I usually try to avoid long waiting times at the airport. That’s why I arrive at the gate later than most passengers. From this I realized that if you board the plane as last passenger you can just choose among all free seats. Now on long flights I’ll always be the last person boarding. If you’re lucky you’ll get the empty seat row you wouldn’t have gotten otherwise. So board the plane as the last person and choose where you sit freely. Sure you can’t just sit in business class, just because there’s a free seat.TL;DR: Use your brains before making your life harder than necessary. Unlike at home whilst travelling there aren’t as many established structures you can rely on.",

        "content": "I need LEDs, a lot of LEDs. About 13.000 for a lighting project. That should be about 1400$ worth of LED. Therefore here is the result of the research I did to prevent wasting a huge load of cash I do not have anyways.WS2801This is the first generation of control ICs by World Semiconductor which requires a separate clock input additional to data (SPI).WS2811This is the generation after the WS2801. This IC only requires data input and works with a fixed clock speed of either 400kHz or 800kHz, which might require you to save all stripe color values in a buffer in order to match the required speed.WS2812This is the name for an SMD LED package with an integrated WS2811 IC.WS2812BThis is the improved version of the WS2812. It has a brighter LED with a more uniform color distribution. Also it features an reverse protection circuit, which will prevent breaking the stripe when attaching the power source in the wrong order.WS2813This is the latest version. It works just like WS2812B, but also tolerates failing pixels: see video.sourceSK6812The SK6812 is a clone of the WS2812, that is completely compatible. It’s PWM frequency is twice that of the WS2812B which should result in less flickering.sourceAPA102These LEDs are designed by APA Electronic co. LTD. They don’t show any visible PWM flicker when moving the LED due to a very high modulation frequency (19.2 kHz). The full brighness setting (31) should be used to reduce flicker. It was tested running with 60MHz SPI.source 1source 2SK9822These are a clone of the APA102. Unfortunately it has a slightly different behaviour regarding it’s protocol since every frame will be displayed on receiving the next start frame. That results in updating all LEDs at once unlike with the APA102 or WS28XX.sourceConclusionTO DO: write a conclusion and order LED stripe                   SK9822      SK6812      APA102      WS2813      WS2812B      WS2812      WS2811      WS2801                  Update      Simultaneous      Staggered      Staggered      Staggered      Staggered      Staggered      Staggered      Staggered              Update trigger      Reset frame (0x00000000)      RGB data transmission      RGB data transmission      RGB data transmission      RGB data transmission      RGB data transmission      RGB data transmission      RGB data transmission              PWM Frequency      ~4.7 kHz      ~1.1kHz      ~19.2 kHz      2kHz      430 Hz      430 Hz      430 Hz      2.5 kHz              Global brightness control      programmable current source      PWM at ~440 Hz      -      -      -      -      -      -              max data rate      30MHZ      800 kB/s      20MBit/s (max input clock)      800 kB/s      800 kB/s      800 kB/s      800 kB/s      25MBit/s (max input clock)              Best Price $/m (IP30)      21.42      16.70      20.71      18.72      13.57      11.72      144 LED/m not possible      144 LED/m not possible      Voltage dropIn order to overcome voltage drop with long LEDs strips a higher voltage is better. Otherwise power injection every couple meters will be required.ConclusionFinally I decided to purchase the WS2812, because when ordering a lot of LEDs the price difference is very noticeable. (1680€ vs. 1050€) The data speed of 800 kBit/s is enough to run 4 meters of stripe with 60 frames per second. To me the missing features of reverse polarity protection and tolerating failing pixels isn’t worth almost twice the price if you compare WS2812 to WS2813. Also the lower PWM frequency is acceptable since the object and the viewer won’t move around very fast. Also the external resistor next to every LED is a downside compared to WS2813. 🦄🔥",

        "content": "The problemYou are pushing LateX documents into a repository with all of your friends. Your friends compile the PDF files locally and sometimes push garbage into the repo. Also you want to email your assignments to your tutors. But you are already annoyed by writing commit messages. Opening your email client and dragging and dropping that PDF, for you it’s pain in it’s purest form. This makes you very sad. You ask yourself: What could I do about it?The solutionCombining some Python scripting and GitLab-CI configs results in a nice pipeline that processes LaTeX documents automatically while enforcing a certain folder structure. No more garbage and no more pain. Find the example repo here.The working GitLab CI pipelineThe script outputThe uploaded resulting artifacts accessible in GitLabEmailFor emailing a document for example to your tutors the scripts/pipeline/latexpipeline.py submodule will parse the commit message and search for the --final flag. In our example the commit messageAdd my assignment no 5 --final assignment_papers/documentfoldername --comment Sorry for my late submission, it will not happen again! 😇💋would result in an raw text email being sent to the recipient specified in scripts/pipeline_script.py with the email of the GitLab User being CCed as Reply-To.The mail being sent to the address defined in scripts/pipeline_script.pyTelegram and IFTTWith a little help by IFTTT.com it’s very easy to integrate Telegram notifications into the system using a bot. One benefit is certainly shaming users into testing their TeX files before submitting them knowing that their utter failure will be public.Exemplary Telegram notifications about successes and failuresThe applets for the bachelorprojects Telegram group including the Webhook based applet forwarding messages to the Telegram bot.A short intro to GitLab CIGitLab CI is like any other continuous integration platform with the additional feature of job artifacts. This means a job can produce files as output that will be stored and and can be directly linked to on the GitLab platform. Of course this is ideal for our LaTeX pipeline. Let’s take a look at the compile_pdf stage:compile_pdf:  stage: compile_pdf  before_script:    - rm -rf htmlcov  script:    - python3 scripts/pipeline_script.py run \"$GITLAB_USER_NAME\" $CI_JOB_ID \"$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)\" $GITLAB_USER_EMAIL $CI_PROJECT_URL  cache:    key: single_pdfs    paths:      - assignment_papers/latex_output      - letters/latex_output  artifacts:    paths:      - assignment_papers/*.pdf      - letters/*.pdf  only:    - masterFirst it executes the scripts/pipeline_script.py script. The necessary arguments are the GitLab variables $GITLAB_USER_NAME, $CI_JOB_ID, $GITLAB_USER_EMAIL and $CI_PROJECT_URL as well as the current commit message: $(git log -1 --pretty=%B). The executed scripts/pipeline_script.py will write all files resulting from document compilation to assignment_papers/latex_output/* and letters/latex_output/* and copy the PDFs to assignment_papers/*.pdf and `letters/*.pdf/.Setting the key cache results in all files specified under paths being cached between job runs given you’re using a dedicated GitLab runner. Alos it will speed up compilation because documents will only be recompiled if there’s a change. In our example case it reduced the runtime from 5 minutes to just 1 minute. Unfortunately the free shared runners on gitlab.com don’t allow this. But what about the job artifacts?The scripts/pipeline_script.py script will copy the resulting PDFs from foldername/latex_output/*pdf to foldername/*.pdf. This happens at the PIPELINE.move_pdfs() function call. Thus we specify under artifacts the paths where GitLab CI will look for matching files to store them as artifacts.Processing time without caching and with enabled caching.What does the script do?Ultimately after checking that the folder structures are compliant the script will execute the following lines in the scripts/pipeline/latexpipeline.py submodule:        for dir_name, data in second_level_items.items():            main_filename = dir_name + \".tex\"            folderpath = join(self.relative_path, dir_name)            cmd = ('cd \"{fp}\" &amp;&amp; latexmk -output-directory=../latex_output -pdf \"{f}\"'\\                \" -e '$pdflatex=q/pdflatex %O -shell-escape %S/'\")\\                .format(fp=folderpath, f=main_filename)            if call(cmd, shell=True) == 0:                sccmsg = \"\\033[92mCompiled \\033[94m{d}.tex\\033[92m successfully\\033[0m\"\\                    .format(d=dir_name)                print(sccmsg)            else:                errmsg = \"\\033[91mError with compiling \\033[94m{d}.tex\\033[0m\\ncmd: {c}\"\\                    .format(d=dir_name, c=cmd)                self.error_notify_and_exit(errmsg)The dictionary second_level_items contains all but the exempted subfolders in a valid root subdirectory. Now all it does for a folder called documentfoldername residing in assignment_papers is executing these commands:cd documentfoldernamelatexmk -output-directory=../latex_output -pdf \"documentfoldername.tex\" -e '$pdflatex=q/pdflatex %O -shell-escape %S/'After executing the script will print a success message. If the command fails it will notify about this and exit with an error so that the GitLab job will fail.Enforcing folder rulesThe script scripts/pipeline_script.py enforces a folder structure like this:.|+--assignment_papers|  +--documentfoldername|  |  +--figures|  |  |  +--example.png|  |  +--documentfoldername.tex|  |  +--preamble.tex|  |  +--content.tex|  +--otherdocumentfoldername|  |  +--figures|  |  |  +--example.pdf|  |  +--otherdocumentfoldername.tex|  |  +--preamble.tex|  |  +--content.tex+--letters|  +--documentfoldername|  |  +--figures|  |  |  +--example.jpg|  |  +--documentfoldername.tex|  +--otherdocumentfoldername|  |  +--figures|  |  |  +--example.jpg|  |  +--otherdocumentfoldername.tex  there can be multiple folders the root directory          assignment_papers                  subfolders must contain .tex files with the same name          subfolders must contain preamble.tex file          subfolders must contain content.tex file          subfolders may contain a figures folder                    letters                  subfolders must contain .tex files with the same name          subfolders may contain a figures folder                    These rules are determined in the scripts/pipeline_script.py in the FOLDER_STRUCTURES dictionary. It maps the root level subfolder names to folder structure rules formatted as dictionaries. For example if a subfolders name begins with a string in the list referenced by the \"exempt_dirs_start_with\" key it will be exempted from being processed by the pipeline.#root level directories we won't processEXEMPT_DIRS = [\"scripts\", \"__pycache__\"]#dirs starting with given string in LateXPipeline.relative_path will be ignored#also applied to root level dirsEXEMPT_DIRS_START_WITH = [\".\"]#files mandatory in each LaTeX folderMANDATORY_FILES_ASSIGNMENT = [\"preamble.tex\", \"references.bib\", \"content.tex\"]#directories in LateXPipeline.relative_path the pipeline will ignoreEXEMPT_DIRS_ASSIGNMENT = [\"latex_output\", \"BP_COMBINED\", \"__pycache__\"]#folders allowed but not mandatory in subdirectoriesALLOWED_SUBDIRS = [\"figures\"]#allowed folder structure for folder assignment_papersFOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT = {\"exempt_dirs\": EXEMPT_DIRS_ASSIGNMENT,\\    \"exempt_dirs_start_with\": EXEMPT_DIRS_START_WITH,\\    \"mandatory_files\": MANDATORY_FILES_ASSIGNMENT,\\    \"allowed_subdirs\": ALLOWED_SUBDIRS}#allowed folder structure for folder lettersFOLDER_STRUCTURE_LETTERS = dict(FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT)FOLDER_STRUCTURE_LETTERS[\"mandatory_files\"] = []#different folder structures for each root level dir#test_root_folder(_one/two) is necessary for pytest testingFOLDER_STRUCTURES = {\"test_root_folder\": FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT,\\    \"test_script_root_folder\": FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT,\\    \"test_folder_one\": FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT, \"test_folder_two\": FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT,\\    \"assignment_papers\": FOLDER_STRUCTURE_ASSIGNMENT, \"letters\": FOLDER_STRUCTURE_LETTERS}Known issuesThere is still a problem with calculating the code coverage. As seen in the current example repo  the displayed code coverage is just about 80% when it should be very close to 100 percent. Unfortunately the tests in scripts/tests/test_latexpipeline.py calling the script with subprocess.run won’t be measured by codecov:def test_console_test_usage(self):     \"\"\"Check that Latexmk actually works and the module can be invoked as script from command line\"\"\"     ret = subprocess.run(\"python3 \" + RELATIVE_SCRIPT_PATH + ' test test@test.de \"Test --meta lol\"',\\         shell=True, cwd=SCRIPT_TEST_ROOT_DIR_PATH, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)     print(ret.stderr)     assert b\"YAY\" in ret.stdout     assert b\"Latexmk\" in ret.stderr",

        "content": "Ein Touristen-VISA für einen Kubaaufenthalt zu bekommen ist nicht schwer, der Tourismus ist eine feste Devisenquelle für die kleine Karibische Insel mit seiner so wilden Vergangenheit. Spanische Kolonie, Revolution und Kubakrise lautet die Kurzzusammenfassung. Und nun ist Kuba eines der wenigen Länder, welches sich noch der Coca-Cola-Marktwirtschaft verweigert. Es sei der Vollständigkeit halber angemerkt, dass es dennoch ein leichtes ist, auf Kuba käuflich eine Cola zu erwerben.Die Republik Kuba wartet mit tropisch-feuchtheißem Meeresklima auf und die Hauptinsel ist 1200 Kilometer lang und zwischen 30 und 190 Kilometer breit. Insgesamt leben dort 11,2 Millionen Kubaner. Zusammen erwirtschaften sie ein BIP von 85 Milliarden USD (2015), wobei das Durchschnittseinkommen bei 29 USD liegt. Auf Kuba waren einige Werbetafeln zu sehen, welche für Demokratie und die anstehenden Wahlen warben. Das auswärtige Amt bemerkt hierzu jedoch lakonisch in den Länderinformationen:Regierungspartei:ausschließlich zugelassen: Kommunistische Partei KubasOpposition:neben der Kommunistischen Partei sind keine anderen Parteien zugelassenDabei dürfte es sich wohl um ein diplomatische Formulierung handeln. Auch der folgende Auszug macht deutlich, wie es um die demokratische Verfassung Kubas bestellt ist:Besucher sollten politische Betätigung unterlassen, dies kann mit hohen Haftstrafen geahndet werden.Dann gibt es da noch die Sache mit den zwei Währungen CUC und CUP. Ein CUC (Peso convertible) ist einen US-Dollar wert, 24 CUP (Peso cubano) entsprechen 1 CUC und können nicht in Fremdwährung getauscht werden. Der CUP wird hauptsächlich zur Bezahlung staatlich subventionierter Waren benutzt und ist für die meisten Touristen folglich irrelevant. Nichtsdestoweniger ist es bemerkenswert, dass sich Kuba zwei Währungen leistet. Zwar wurde 2013 angekündigt die Währungen zusammenführen zu wollen, doch auch ich habe Leute mit CUP zahlen sehen.Um die zur Einreise erforderliche Touristenkarte zu erhalten, begibt man sich zum kubanischen Konsulat in Berlin und erhältdiese nach kurzer Wartezeit. Es wiehert der Amtsschimmel. Die Räumlichkeiten selbst geben ein Vor­ge­fühl auf das Reiseland. In dem zweifelsohne noch der DDR entsprungenen Bau nimmt eine ältere Dame hinter einem hohen Tresen Gesuche entgegen und bittet auf einem der muffigen Sessel Platz zu nehmen. Das WiFi funktioniert nicht. Insgesamt eine gute Einstimmung auf Kuba.HavannaZeitsprung, Ortswechsel, ich bin grade am La Habana Aeroporto gelandet. Von dort nehme ich ein Taxi zum Hostel. Auf der Fahrt wird bereits ersichtlich, dass Havanna eine morbide Schönheit ist. Die vielen bunten Häuser und Autos sind hübsch anzusehen. Sie scheinen ein wenig aus der Zeit gefallen und eisern dem Verfall zu trotzen. Überall sind die für Kuba bekannten Oldtimer zu sehen. Einige Modelle sehen noch aus wie neu, andere hingegen lassen ernsthaft um Sicherheit der Insassen fürchten. Was man auf den tollen Werbeprospekt-Bildchen nicht sieht, ist der zugehörige Geruch, wenn eine ganze Insel verkehrstechnisch die Siebziger-Jahre wiederaufleben lässt. Nach einer Weile gewöhnt man sich zwar an den Benzingestank, dennoch schmälert dies den Charme der bulligen Cruiser auf den Straßen.An der Adresse angekommen wundere ich mich erst einmal, wo denn das Hostel ist. An der Stelle an welcher das Hostel sein sollte sehe ich lediglich eine baufällige Ruine. Hat sich der Taxifahrer verfahren? Am winzigen Schild am Eingang erkenne ich schließlich, dass besagte Ruine renovierungsbedürftige Baute meine Unterkunft für die nächsten Tage ist. In Havanna sind sehr viele Gebäude marode, dennoch wohnen Leute in den Häusern. Selbst Gebäude, die in den letzen Atemzügen liegen, werden noch bewohnt. Insofern passt das Hostel gut ins Bild, zum Glück sieht es innen deutlich besser aus. Die quirlige Hostelbesitzerin Aylin erklärt allen Gästen Kuba und was man umbedingt gesehen haben muss. Außerdem beklagt sie, dass sie für den ganzen Monat lediglich 30 Stunden Internetzugang erhält. Dennoch kostet es 50 CUC, was etwa 50 Euro entspricht. Der einschlägige Telekom-Manager dürfte hier eine Freudenträne nicht unterdrücken können.Das Cuba 58 HostelEffektive Lösung gegen die marode Fassade: Von innen nach außen schauen.Pluspunkt: Das Dach war sehr aufgeräumt.Eine Gasse trotzt der Zeit.Eine weitere Gasse trotzt ebenfalls der Zeit.Sozialismus trifft auf spanische Kolonialzeit.Geht man vor die Tür, fällt dem deutschen Auge sofort eine ungewohnte Gelassenheit der Menschen auf. Die Menschen gehen gelassen durch die Stadt und hetzen nicht. Das Leben findet auf der Straße statt.Nicht vergessen darf man den obligatorischen Besuch des Revolutionsmuseums in welchem die Befreiung Kubas durch Fidel Castro und Che Guevara als Musical Ausstellung dargeboten wird. Das Museum selbst ist –  wie so vieles hier – in einem Dämmerzustand gefangen. Zersprungene Fenster, Farbkleckse auf dem Boden, Baugerüste und sogar arbeitende Maler verteilen sich im Museum. Dennoch strahlt das Gebäude eine Grandezza aus, welche von der bedeutsamen Historie zeugt. Die spanischen Kolonialherren, der Diktator Batista und schließlich Fidel Castro selbst nutzten das Gebäude als Regierungssitz. Teile des Gebäudes lassen noch immer erahnen, wie prunkvoll es sich hier einst gelebt haben lassen musste. Der Museumsabschnitt, welcher die Zeit nach der Revolution behandelt, berichtet nüchtern von der Verstaatlichung der amerikanischen Unternehmen und der politisch Linke Teil in mir freut sich heimlich etwas. Darüber hinaus findet die CIA viel unrühmliche Erwähnung, Dengue-Fieber-Epidemien, Schweinepest, Nutztierseuchen und Angriffe auf Plantagen soll sie laut Ausstellung zu verantworten haben. Auch wenn die CIA eindeutig Sabotagepläne verfolgt hat, bleibt fraglich ob es soweit ging gezielt Krankheiten zu verbreiten. Dafür und für die Schweinebuchtinvasion gibt es dann am Ausgang auch die bei Besuchern populäre US-Präsidenten-Karikaturen (+ Batista).Im Außenbereich finden sich Artefakte aus der Geschichte Kubas. Neben dem Boot auf dem Castro vor der erfolgreichen Revolution mit nur 50 Männern übersetzte findet sich auch allerlei vermischtes. So hat es das Triebwerk eines abgeschossenen U2-Spionageflugzeugs der Amerikaner in den Geschichtspark geschafft. Soldaten in strenger Uniform wachen über die Besucher und greifen bei Betreten des Rasens beherzt zur revolutionären Trillerpfeife. Alles in allem hat der Mythos Revolution an Glanz eingebüßt, die “Che Guevara”-Wachsfigur kann nicht den maroden Zustand Kubas vergessen machen. Ob dies als Narrativ stark genug ist, um die Menschen vom Aufbegehren und den Versuchungen des Kapitalismus abzuhalten wird die Zukunft zeigen.Einschusslöcher, welche aus der Erstürmung des Gebäudes durch die Revolutionsgarden stammen sollen.\"Unter den Talaren, der Muff von Tausend Jahren\" mag auch hier passend erscheinen, obschon Fidel Castro selbst hier zum El Presidente ernannt wurde.Repräsentativer Ausschnitt aus der Ausstellung.Madamé Tussauds auf Kubanisch (Madamé Esperanza?)Ob Obama und Trump bereits in Arbeit sind?Doch was sagen eigentlich die Kubaner zu all dem? Ein junger Kubaner, welcher an der Universität in Havanna studiert möchte umbedingt Kuba verlassen und erzählt, dass er lediglich nach einem Arbeitgeber sucht, welcher ihm den Umzug finanziert. Mit dem vorherrschenden System scheint er wenig anfangen zu können. Er erklärt, dass es hier normal sei, dass ein Taxifahrer mehr verdient als ein Arzt. Dies deckt sich mit Aussagen aus Reiseführern in welchen beschrieben steht, dass hinter vielen kubanischen Ärzten und Professoren, Burgerbrater und Putzkräfte im Ausland stehen, welche mit ihren Geldüberweisungen die geistige Landeselite querfinanzieren. Die Limitierung auf 200 Megabyte Internet pro Woche für Studierende ist sicherlich ebenfalls ein Problem. In ganz Havanna gibt es aktuell nur 60 WIFI-Hotspots des staatlichen Internetproviders. Dort versammeln sich die Menschen für die tägliche Dosis Netz. Auch die langen Schlangen vor den Internetkartenläden zeugen von einem digitalen Versorgungsmangel.Zufälligerweise treffe ich einen der Maintainer des kubanischen Internetersatzes SNET. Neben El paquete – bestehend aus Festplatten welche wöchentlich aktualisiert und geteilt werden, stellt SNET einen weiteren Weg dar, um Daten zu teilen. Dies erfolgt ohne Internetzugang in einem lokalen Mesh-Netzwerk. Dieser erzählt auch von allerhand Problemen mit technischer Infrastruktur und den findigen Workarounds. Auch erfahre ich, dass die Kubaner ihre Kommunikationsdaten zur weitergehenden Analyse vermutlich an die Russen weitergeben. Die Frage warum Kubas Internetversorgung zu den schlechtesten der Welt gehört bleibt jedoch unklar. Angst vor Oppositions oder schlicht Ignoranz und Ressourcenmangel könnten Gründe sein.VaraderoDie Touristenhochburg Varadero liegt drei Stunden Autofahrt östlich von Havanna. Hier finden sich karibischer Katalogsandstrand und eine Reihe von All-Inclusive-Bunkern, die sich wie an einer Perlenkette aufgeschnürt um die Strände Varaderos legen. Der lokalen Bevölkerung von 20.000 Menschen stehen jährlich 1.000.000 Besucher gegenüber. Für das gute Karma übernachte ich in einer Casa Particular. Für 35 CUC pro Nacht bietet die Wohnung neben einer Dusche, welche eine Art elektrischer Stuhl darstellt auch sonst wenig erfreuliches.Ein geradezu unverschämt gutaussehender Strand.Spätrömische Dekadenz.Liebevolles Detail: Duschen mit Adrenalinkick und potenziell tödlichem Ausgang (Man beachte die an die Decke geklebte Erdung).Die Casa Particular von außen.Wie sehr man an den Überfluss gewohnt ist, merkt man in den Supermärkten mit ihrem übersichtlichem Sortiment.Die Preise sind verglichen mit Deutschland  genauso hoch bzw. teurer.Neben all dem Disneyland-Charme eines Tourismusortes versöhnt die wunderschöne Natur – dort wo sie erhalten wurde – schnell. Am Ende der Halbinsel auf welcher Varadero liegt, besteht ein Naturschutgebiet mit Wäldern und Höhlen, welche man erkunden kann. In den Höhlen nisten Fledermäuse, zudem gibt es teilweise tausende Jahre alte Malereien von den Ureinwohnern sowie den afrikanischen Sklaven. So ganz ohne Internet in einer Höhle auf Kuba kommt selbst der pathologischste Internettroll zur Ruhe. Die Natur wirkt wie ein angenehmes Sedativum gegen die moderne Smartphone-, Newsfeed- und Pushnotification-Welt.Eine der vielen natürlichen Höhlen.Wenn ein Stadtkind plötzlich auf Wald trifft.Alles in allem ist Kuba einen Besuch wert. Wenn man nicht nur im touristischen Paralleluniversum am Sandstrand bleibt, gibt es auf Kuba viel zu entdecken. Dies kann auch die ein oder andere Lebensmittelvergiftung nicht schmälern. Leider habe ich die Größe Kubas völlig unterschätzt. Man sollte genug Zeit einplanen, um die ganze Insel zu entdecken. Hinzu kommt, dass das Leben recht teuer ist, da der Staat die Wirtschaft kontrolliert und Tourismus eine wichtige Einahmequelle ist. Einfach in einen Supermarkt zu gehen und selbst etwas zu kochen ist nicht so einfach. Dies hat sich bemerkbar gemacht, als ich danach in Mexico (freie Marktwirtschaft + keine Insel) war und festellen musste, dass ich dort viel länger Leben könnte, ohne dass eine Pleite droht. Auf Kuba lagen die Lebenshaltungskosten bei circa 42 Euro pro Tag. Auch fiel auf, dass auf Kuba zwar ein niedrigerer Lebensstandard als in Mexico-City herrscht, aber auf Kuba niemand auf der Straße um Geld gebettelt hat. Die Frage wäre ob dies nun Sozialismus oder strikterem Vorgehen gegen Bettler zuzuschreiben ist. Kuba wird nach dem Abdanken Raul Castros in diesem Jahr sich womöglich öffnen und ein anderes Kuba werden, als jenes, das ich erleben durfte.TL;DR;Kuba ist sehr schön und es gibt für Besucher einen faktischen Internetzölibat.",

        "content": "Größte Demokratie der Welt, Schwellenland, G20, Kolonialherrschaft, Ghandi. Man verbindet viele Begriffe mit Indien. Doch dass diese letztlich nur ein schwaches Schlaglicht auf das in jeder Hinsicht enorme Land werfen, ist klar. Wie der Zufall es will, hat es mich unlängst für 7 Tage nach Indien verschlagen. Nein, ich habe nicht in einem Radiogewinnspiel gewonnen, aber es spielte sich in etwa ähnlich ab. Hauptgrund der Reise war der Flugpreis von 200 Euro, da es sich um eine sogenannte Errorfare handelte. Also keine hochtrabenden Weltendeckerambitionen, Selbstfindungsfantasien oder ungestüme Abenteuerlust – schlicht schnöde weltlicher Ökonomismus. Daher folgt eine kleine Abhandlung über Indien in 7 Tagen.Ohne allzu viel Vorbereitung – positiver Formuliert könnte man auch ohne Voreingenommenheit sagen – ging es daher eines Freitags los. Im Vorhinein habe ich mir zugegeben wahrlich nicht allzu viele Gedanken gemacht, lediglich ein kleines, aber feines Buch von Bernard Imhasly mit dem naheliegenden Titel Indien diente der Vorbereitung. Indiens Geschichte ist eine komplexe Materie. So war ich etwas überrascht und irgendwie doch auch nicht, dass laut Autor das Land Indien eine Illusion sei. Vielmehr handelt es sich bei Indien um eine Vielzahl von Völkern, die wie so häufig in der früheren Geschichte einmal von ihren Kolonialherren zusammengelegt wurden. Nachdem aber die Selbstständigkeit Indiens etabliert wurde – Ghandi, wir erinnern uns – schlug sich dies nicht nur in der Abspaltung Pakistans, sondern auch in einer im hohen Maße föderalen Staatsstruktur nieder. Noch heute gibt es Probleme mit SIM-Karten, wenn man den Bundesstaat wechselt. Aber wir wollen uns nicht zu lange mit profanen Fakten beschäftigen. Es folgt nun viel der erste Akt “Ankunft in Mumbai”:Schon beim Anflug auf Mumbai fallen dem aufmerksamen Beobachter, wie auch dem artverwandten unaufmerksamen Beobachter, die bis direkt an die Landebahn angrenzenden Hütten auf. “Nanu” wundert sich der Westler, jetzt offenbart diese Stadt einem schon Slumdog-Millionaire-Anspielungen und denkt an romantische Slum-Eintracht und das ewig währende Märchen vom Aufstiegskampf. Bin ich jetzt überhaupt darauf vorbereitet? Will ich das alles nicht erst einmal aus der Ferne und wenn überhaupt dann am letzten Tag sehen? Aber so ist Mumbai nicht, ohne falsche Zurückhaltung schleudert es dem Besucher ab Tag Eins alles entgegen, was es aufzubieten vermag – und das ist viel. Romantische Anwandlungen verfliegen schnell. Man sieht allenthalben, dass Indien ein Schwellenland ist. Die Wellblechhütte grenzt direkt an Prachtbauten, Familien schlafen auf der Straße, während andere sich im nicht unwerten Rolex-Store verlustieren. Das ist vor allem einmal eine große Reizüberflutung, der Verkehr ist aberwitzig. Schnell muss man lernen seinen Weg durch das Chaos zu finden. Die ersten Tage ist jeder Wechsel der Straßenseite eine kleine Mutprobe. Während man selbst mit sich hadert, zetert und zaudert, geht der Inder lässig ohne großes überlegen durch den Verkehr, den Autofahrern die Handinnenfläche entgegenstreckend. Solche Szenen haben fast eine mystische Komponente, so wie ehedem Jesus das Meer teilte, teilt nun Sunjai den Verkehr. Toll denke ich, während ich dem indischen Jesus hinterhereile. Auch eine neue Spielregel, die ich verinnerlichen musste, war die Tatsache, dass im indischen Straßenverkehr die Hupe eher wie ein Martinshorn genutzt wird. Dies resultiert natürlich in ein fortwährendes, dysharmonisches Hupkonzert. Sieht man Fußgänger vor sich, überholt man ein anderes Fahrzeug, kündigt man sich mit einem kurzen Hupton an. Dies scheint auch relativ gut zu funktionieren, jedenfalls habe ich keinen einzigen Unfall miterlebt, obwohl der chaotische Verkehr die ständige Erwartung eines Unglücks forciert.Aber auch das Zugfahren unterscheidet sich nicht unbeträchtlich von der gewohnten europäischen Art. Es fängt damit an, dass in Zügen die Türen prinzipiell offen bleiben. Das was das Zugfahren prinzipiell erst einmal auch angenehmer gestalten kann – je nach Mut kann man sich mehr oder weniger weit aus der Tür lehnen – deckt natürlich auch ein diametrales Sicherheitsdenken auf. Bauarbeiter, welche barfüßig mit schwerem Gerät arbeiten, Leute die auf dem Gleisbett gehen, abenteuerliche Baukonstruktionen: Vielerorts schüttelt man als jemand, der westlich sozialisiert wurde erschrocken den Kopf. Mumbai ist eine extrem dicht besiedelte Stadt, was dazu führt, dass die kleinen Hütten in jede freie Stelle gebaut werden. Teilweise unter Bahnbrücken, ineinander verschachtelt und auch übereinander gestapelt. An einer S-Bahn-Haltestelle sehe ich eine Hütte, die halb Zelt, halb Hütte ist. Fast erinnert es ein wenig an eine Unterkunft in einem Freizeitcamp. Doch man darf sich nicht täuschen, natürlich ist dies schlicht auch eine Folge der bitteren Armut. Viele Hütten haben zwar Strom – woher ist eine andere Frage – ihnen fehlt es jedoch an Zugang zu Kanalisation und Wasserversorgung. Grade die Kinder mit Müttern, die auf offener Straße schlafen sind ein bedrückendes Bild, welches sich ins Gedächtnis brennt. Auch die kleinen Mädchen, welche am Bahnhof Essen verkaufen und Männer, Frauen, Greise mit Behinderungen, welche am Bahnhof sitzen, liegen, betteln lassen einen tiefen Eindruck zurück. Ich habe mich geschämt für meinen Reichtum, für den Reichtum den die entwickelte Welt hat während es hier Menschen so elendig schlecht geht. Da stellt sich einem schon die Frage, mit welcher moralischen Begründung wir diesen Menschen unseren Lebensstandard vorenthalten und ob unser Lebensstandard überhaupt möglich wäre, wenn er hier ebenso vorherrschte. Ich habe keine zufriedenstellende gefunden.Die ersten Tage kommen wir zeitgemäß via AirBnB in einem kleinen, feinen Appartement im zentralen Stadtteil Colaba unter. Die Wohnung gehört einer Inderin, welche aber erzählt, dass sie die meiste Zeit in Großbritannien lebt, weil sie es in Indien nicht lange aushält. Als ich Abends sichtlich von Mumbai überfordert in die Wohnung komme, schwärmt sie von Dänemark (“Everything just works. It’s so clean!”) und berichtet auch von London (“It’s also a bit dirty. I prefer Kopenhagen.”). Außerdem ist sie seit 10 Jahren in Mumbai nicht mehr mit dem Zug gefahren, weil es ihr zu eng und chaotisch ist. Ich fühle mich verstanden, als ich dann jedoch erfahre, dass sie mit einer zwanghaften Persönlichkeitsstörung diagnostiziert ist, schlägt das Verbundenheitsgefühl in leichte Selbstzweifel um. Aha, deshalb ist ihre Wohnung so sauber! Man fühlt sich ein wenig fehlplatziert in der keimfreien, katalogreifen Wohnung. Auch allgemein ist es ein Phänomen, dass in Indien die Innenräume penibel sauber gehalten werden. Man würde fast meinen, dass ein Kausalzusammenhang zwischen diesem Umstand und dem Dreck auf der Straße besteht. Wer seine Wohnung so sauber hält, kann das ja nicht auch noch für die Straße ebenso sicherstellen. Das obig erwähnte Indienbüchlein bemerkt hierzu, dass dies auch religiöse Gründe habe. Die Natur werde nicht wie etwa im Christentum als zu bewahrende Schöpfung gesehen, sondern vielmehr als etwas, dass in der Hand der Götter liegt. Exemplarisch wird hierfür ist der Ganges angeführt, der schon einige erfolglose Reinigungsvorhaben hinter sich hat, die am fehlenden Rückhalt und Bewusstsein scheiterten.Die Küche in Mumbai ist vegetarisch dominiert und sehr herzhaft und außerordentlich soßenreich. Mal abgesehen von den studentenfreundlichen Preisen – wir haben selbst in teureren Lokalitäten nie mehr als 10 Euro p.P. gezahlt – zeichnet sie sich durch ihre reichhaltige Vielfalt aus. Oft kommt ein Gericht sekundiert von einem Pulk an Soßen und Beilagen, sodass man als simpler Amateuresser oft bereits von Anfang an als Verlierer in die Schlacht zieht. Spätestens bei dem Menü inklusive Bathura-Flatrate ist eine Grenze des Möglichen überschritten. Auch im Restaurant findet sich die omnipräsente Spiritualität wieder, wenn sich plötzlich müde Rauchschwaden behäbig durch das Lokal walzen und in gravitätischem Ernst einer der vielen Gottheiten huldigen. Fast gleicht es dem Vorgang des Insektizidversprühens bei der Ein- und Ausreise in der Passagierkabine. Da heißt es man müsse Vorschriften beachten, vielleicht ja auch nur ein Opfer für die Götter, damit der Flug unter der Ägide Krishnas kein jähes Ende findet. Kurz gesagt, wer nach Indien reist, wird nicht verhungern.to be continued&hellip;.TL;DRIndien erscheint Europäern sehr laut und chaotisch.",

        "content": "[Fotos kommen später noch, es müssen erst einmal die Gifs genügen]Die eindrücklichste Wahrnehmung meines ersten Tages, war nicht die drückende Hitze, die vielen Menschen,  - nein - es war der Geruch. Es ist schwer festzumachen, jedenfalls kommt es wahrscheinlich durch die andere Küche zustande. Generell bemerkt man verschiedenste Gerüche, wenn man auf den Straßen unterwegs ist. Mir fielen sie eher unangnehm auf, aber auch hier zeigt sich, wie adaptiv das menschlichen Gehirn ist: Rund 4 Tage später bemerke ich davon fast nichts mehr. Die ersten zwei Tage verlaufen im Zeitraffer und bestehen in der Hauptsache aus holprigen Orientierungsversuchen. Beginnen wir daher doch bei Tag 3.Zusammen mit einer Freundin, die ich aus Berlin kenne, sollte es heute auf den ikonischen Berggipfel gehen. Quasi das Zuckerhutäquivalent Hong Kongs. Die Kabelbahnfahrt auf den Gipfel und zurück mutete wie eine Slowmotion-Achterbahnfahrt an. Furchtsame Gemüter wie ich können bei den gefühlt vertikalen Streckenabschnitten auf ihre Kosten kommen, insbesondere bei der Talfahrt wünscht man sich ein weniger qualvolles Tempo. Oben angekommen, krankt es wie ich es aus China schon kenne an einer schamlosen Kommerzialisierung. Auf dem Gipfel mit der Aussichtsplatform kommt man direkt in einem Shoppingcenter an und muss sich über 6 Etagen über Rolltreppen an allerlei Belanglosigkeiten, wie dem obligatorischen Madame Tussauds, vorbeikämpfen, um auf die Platform zu gelangen. Dort bot sich neben einem atemberaubenden Ausblick auch eine fürs europäische Auge (noch) ungewohnte Szenerie: Nicht ohne dabei einen gewissen Stolz zum Ausdruck zu bringen, recken sich die errigierten Selfiesticks im Dutzend in die Höhe. Hier vergewissert sich der Mensch seiner selbst, das Selfie als höchste Form des Seins. Dies sind wohl die Früchte einer - jedenfalls gefühlten - Verkürzung des Lebens auf die Ökonomie und der resultierenden Gesellschaftstendenz zur stärkeren Selbstdarstellung, dachte ich mir bei diesem Anblick. Dann haben wir - natürlich - noch ein Selfie geschossen.Am Abend erhielt ich die Gelegenheit einen Blick in einen Premiumsupermarkt zu werfen, der nur Importprodukte vorhielt. Hier dürfte hauptsächlich die Landeselite und verwirrte Touristen, die sich nicht besser zu helfen wissen, ihren Wochendeinkauf erledigen. Es nimmt sich durchaus bizarr aus, wenn ein magerer Mozzarella - exakt der selbe, den es bei ALDI für moderate 70 Cent gibt - nun plötzlich über einem Preisschild liegt, welches einen maliziös anlächelt und forsch fünf Euro einfordert. Solche Preissteigerungen bei Grenzübertritt kennt man sonst vielleicht noch von Kokain. Scarface mit einem Schreibtisch voll Mozarella? Hier ist dieser Gedanke schlichtweg konsequent. Nudeln mit Barilla-Tomatensoße? Macht 10 Euro bitte. Daher begnügte ich mich mit einem bezaubernd fremdartig anmutenden Mikrowellengericht aus dem Land der Sonne. Nur 6 Euro, ein echtes Schnäppchen also. Dafür hat es dann aber auch geschmeckt, wie frisch zubereitet. Ich lerne: Mikrowelle, das kann der Japaner! Teurer ist manchmal auch wirklich besser. Außerdem: Es gibt Melonen die 70 Euro kosten, ja sie existieren wirklich. Man kann sie anfassen. Ich habe sie angefasst und es fühlt sich so an, als ob man materialisierte Glück unter seiner Handfläche hielte. Ähnlich begeistert der täglich per Luftfracht eingeflogene Mandarinenkorb für 30 Euro. Ein wahrhaftiges Highlight meiner Reise. Es lässt sich aber auch insgesamt festhalten, dass die Stadt recht teuer ist. Mit Deutschland vergleichbar, meistens sogar noch teurer.Tatsächlich habe ich mich bisher weniger mit Historie und Politik auseinandergesetzt, sondern vermehrt mit hiesigem Nachtleben. Diesbezüglich muss insbesondere der Stadtteil Lang Kwai Fong Erwähnung finden: Hier spielt sich das Nachtleben ab. Die Stimmung ist auf den Straßen ausgelassen wie auf einem Festival. So etwas habe ich bisher noch nirgends so erlebt. Die Menschen sind alle ekstatisch und kontaktfreudig. Die klassische Einstiegsfrage lautet “From where are you?”, daraufhin folgt ein spaßiges Akzentraten. Milchbubis, die aussehen, als wären sie erst 13, sitzen hinter dem Steuer eines Lamborghinis oder anderer Fahrzeuge aus der Kategorie &ldquo;Hilfe meine Eltern sind obzön reich und haben mir zweifelhafte Wertvorstellungen vermittelt&rdquo;. Sie möchten einem fast Leid tun, es sind Menschen für die Geld an sich einen Selbstwert darstellt. Ich bekomme von einer Einheimischen erzählt, dass sie Bekannte hat, welche den Tick haben, beim Ausgehen jedes Mal ritualhaft ihre 100.000 Euro teuren Uhren in den geordneten Champagner tunken. Eine Anekdote, die durchaus die Frage aufwirft: Gehören diese 100.000€ wirklich an das Handgelenk eines solchen Neureichenabkömmlings oder in ein Sozialsystem, dass die ausgemergelten Senioren in den Straßengassen versorgt. Das dürfte am Ende beiden Seiten nutzen. Die einen haben Essen, die anderen mehr Realitätsnähe. Aber die Ex-Kolonie, in der Rolexläden wie hierzulande McDonalds-Geschäfte das Stadtbild prägen hat sich augenscheinlich anders entschieden. Kapitalismus fuck yeah. Bekommt man solche Exzesse in Deutschland einfach nicht so sehr mit? Oder ist die hiesige Vermögenselite schlichtweg diskreter, aber keineswegs weniger verdorben? Interessant zu wissen wäre es allemal. Sicherlich gibt es eine weiter entwickelte Kultur des Umgangs mit obszönem Wohlstand, in Asien ist dies noch ein relativ junges Phänomen der Neuzeit.Die Menschen im Ausgehviertel sind etwa hälftig Ausländer und ja, man trifft auch öfters auf das Exemplar des klassischen Bilderbuchsexpats. Je später der Abend wird, desto mehr Massen torkeln gen Taxischlange. An der einen Ecke lässt sich ein Amerikaner von seiner wenig begeisterten Freundin erklären, dass er sich mal vorstellen solle, sie würde vor seinen Augen mit jemand anderem flirten. An der nächsten Ecke schmeißt ein Trunkenbold frohen Mutes Gläser auf die Straße. Etwa ein halbes Dutzend Polizisten findet dies offenbar so interessant, dass sie ihm mit einem beherzten Gewalteinsatz auf seine unausgesprochene Frage &ldquo;Ab welchem Grad wird Idiotie illegal&rdquo; antworten. Einige Straßen weiter wird eine Alkoholeiche auf eine Trage umgelagert. Kurzum: Es ist echt was los. Ich hätte fast ein wenig Sorge im Sog des Nachtlebens zu verschwinden, wenn ich hier leben würde. Tatsächlich hat es ein wenig meine hochtrabenden Pläne mich mehr um kulturellen und historischen Kontext zu bemühen konterkariert. Wie dem auch sei, Ende Oktober werde ich noch einmal Gelegenheit dazu haben. Nächster Halt: Seoul. Ich hoffe, dass ich nach den 12 Tagen dort nicht als K-Pop-Trash ende.",

Und “Erst in der Fremde, erkennt man sich selbst” ist das selbe in Grün. Alles konzeptloses, selbstbezogenes Gellale, könnte man zurecht einwenden. Dennoch wünsche ich mir irgendwie eben das.Vor zwei Jahren bin ich das letzte mal länger allein verreist, seit dem ist viel passiert. Ich habe mich verändert, die Welt hat sich verändert. Ich hoffe bei meinem einmonatigen Trip durch Hong Kong, China und Südkorea offener und neugieriger zu sein. Einher geht mein gewachsener Anspruch mich weniger vor historischen und politischen Dimensionen zu verschließen.Eine schlaue Frage, die man ziemlich allen Menschen stellen kann, die grade von einer Reise kommen lautet “Was hast du erwartet und was hast du vorgefunden?”. Ich habe noch keine genauen Erwartungen, weil ich mich wie meistens - manche werten das als stoisch (ich), andere töricht (nicht ich) - erst kurz vorher oder im Land selbst plane, was genau ich machen werde. In 6 Stunden steige ich in den Flieger. Ziel: Dem Durchschnittswestler vor allem bekannt als Jackie Chans Geburtsort: Hong Kong. Und ich weiß noch nicht wo ich unterkommen werde (Ich freue mich schon auf den nächsten “Obdachlos - Hong Kong authentisch erleben” betitelten Blogpost). Insofern kann ich noch keine Erwartungen niederschreiben, um nachher akribisch mit einem Tabellenkalkulationsprogramm* einen tabellarischen Vergleich zu ziehen.*Anm. d. Red.: Dieses Wortungetüm selbst verströmt den ganzen Sexappeal der vielgeliebten MS Excel Produktreihe, der ja wohl vollkommen unstreitig ist) Wie immer vor größeren Reisen ergibt sich bei mir ein Stimmungsbild mehrerlei gegensätzlicher Gefühle. Es ist eine gewisse Angstlust, die sich breit macht. Das Vertraute verlassen und gegen Ungewissheit eintauschen einerseits, neue Erfahrungen und Perspektiven andererseits. Von einem Abenteuer zu sprechen ginge angesichts der globalisierten Welt wohl etwas zu weit, es ist nicht so, als ob ich bei der Reise ein Bein verlieren könnte (Falls doch fände ich es wahrscheinlich grade wegen dieser Zeilen immerhin durchaus mittel lustig. Wäre ne gute Geschichte für einen Diaabend. Ich kann mir bereits denken, wie aus der Unfallaufnahme ein virales Video wird: “Er schrieb, er würde nicht sein Bein verlieren. Was danach passiert ist unglaublich…”). Jedenfalls habe ich mir vorgenommen den China-Reisebericht Marco Polos zu lesen und einen Vergleich zu heute zu ziehen, ein Unterschied wie Tag und Nacht dürfte es in jedem Fall sein. Nur was sind die sicherlich auch vorhandenen Gemeinsamkeiten? Aber ich schweife ab, dazu später mehr.Ich hoffe, dass ich während dieser Reise ein paar gute Geschichten zu erzählen habe. Hier werde ich sie als Chronist meiner Selbst dem geneigten Publikum darbieten. Die freudvollen wie die unliebsamen Erfahrungen, die noch weit entfernt hinter dem Horizont versteckt warten.",

Rollwagen, Autos und wuselnde Menschen in fahlem Scheinwerferlicht umsäumen den Flieger, der weiter ruhig seinen plastenen, gräulichen Charme verströmt. Das Licht geht an, die Türen auf. Wenn auch erst nach 15 Minuten warten. Genug Zeit um wieder anzukommen. Schlaftrunken taumeln Menschen durch das Terminal.Im Nachtbus bilden die Fahrgäste eine Schicksalsgemeinschaft von kurzer Dauer, ein Federstrich in eines jeden Lebensweg, der schnell verblassen wird. Die Menschen sind müde und in freudiger Erwartung zugleich. Das nasskalte Berlin nimmt seine Kinder wieder in die Arme.

This was my biggest lesson learned, testing is very important, if you ingnore that, you can end up having to cut out a single led. And soldering a single led in a pixel string isn&rsquo;t very fun. There is a neat tutorial on details regarding the pixel string on the resourceful Adafruit website. For testing puposes you can simply use the PixelPi library.Test driven development also makes sense for hardware duh!The next step is cleaning the crates and the bottles. After that every bottle has to be wrapped in aluminium foil. Then poke holes in the bottle caps with a screw driver (and a hammer). If that is done, you have to cut the led pixel strings in right length (20) and solder the connectors onto the string endings where necessary (There are about 150 cables to solder, since the pixel strings come in a length of 50).You have to drink a lot of mate&hellip;The most useful thing i have bought since a year!Be prepared to create a total messNow just insert the led pixel strings in the bottles.

        "content": "Für jeden, der netzpolitische Entwicklungen mit Interesse verfolgt und in Berlin lebt, ist es eigentlich ein Schande, noch nicht ein einziges mal im NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss zu Gast gewesen zu sein. Dabei genügt eine einfache Anmeldung per E-Mail. Daher habe ich selbiges getan und habe dort eine verlängerte Mittagspause geopfert.Kurz gefasst wurde der Ausschuss im März 2014 (Post-Snowden-Zeit) eingesetzt, um aufzuklären inwieweit Deutscher Datenverkehr von den &ldquo;Five Eye Staaten&rdquo; (USA, Großbritannien, Kanada, Australies und Neuseeland) überwacht und gespeichert wurde und ob deutsche Bundesbehörden dabei Amtshilfe leisteten oder Kenntnis davon hatten. Weiter sind die Fragen, ob es rechtswidrige Vorgänge gab bzw. gibt und wie man sich effektiv gegen Abhörmaßnahmen schützen kann, teil des Untersuchungsauftrags.Einmal angekommen, stellt man fest, dass der Ausschuss recht gut besucht ist. Es sind viele junge Menschen dabei. Schnell fällt einem auch Andre Meister auf, welcher die Sitzungen für Netzpolitik.org live verbloggt. Denn die Sitzungen sind zwar öffentlich, dennoch gibt es kein öffentlich zugängliches Protokoll (erst mit Veröffentlichung des Abschlussberichts) oder gar eine Videoaufzeichnung. Heute stand auf der Tagesordung die Zeugenvernehmung von E.B. (Leiter Erfassungsstelle Schöningen, ehemals auch bekannt unter der ofiziellen Bezeichnung Ionosphäreninstitut. Dort hört man Satellitentelefonie(z.B. Thuraya)/GSM ab) und R.S. (er hat auf technischer Ebene für den BND gearbeitet). Wenn ich es richtig verstanden habe, sind sogar die Initialen nur die der Decknamen.Los geht es also mit E.B., der im Eingangsstatement so mechanisch spricht, dass man förmlich spüren kann, wie er innerlich einen vorbereiteten Sprechzettel abliest. Bei der Befragung ist dies anders, dort antwortet der Zeuge mal wortkarg mal ausführlicher. Am häufigsten lautet die Antwort lakonisch &ldquo;Nicht öffentlich&rdquo;. Besonders hervorzuheben ist die Antwort auf die Frage, ob es eine Datenweitergabe an ausländische Geheimdienste gab, da sagt nämlich E.B. mit voller Inbrunst &ldquo;Zu keinem Zeitpunkt gingen irgendwelche Daten an einen Five Eyes Staat, nie.&rdquo;. Diese Aussage wirkt fast sophistisch, muss der Zeuge doch später selbst einräumen, dass es eine Weitergabe von der Zentrale sehr wohl gegeben haben könnte, nur von eben seiner Dienststelle nicht. Auch interessant ist, dass die Bundesregierung einen Beamten aus dem Kanzleramt als Wachhund bereitstellt. Dieser macht sich durch Beanstandungen wie &ldquo;Das ist nicht Untersuchungsgegenstand&rdquo; oder &ldquo;Das liegt nicht im Untersuchungszeitraum&rdquo; bemerkbar, auch sonst merkt man schnell, dass es dem Ausschuss nicht leicht gemacht wird. Die Regierung wirft hier den Abgeordneten eher Knüppel zwischen die Beine. Schön illustriert das der folgende Dialog:Notz: Sie haben alles vorgelegt?E. B.: Ja.Notz: Darf ich Herrn Wolff fragen, ob wir alles bekommen haben? Unser Aktenbestand aus Schöningen ist sehr schmal.Wolff: Davon gehe ich nicht aus. Schöningen als Dienststelle ist nicht Untersuchungsgegenstand. Vor dem Hintergrund gehe ich nicht davon aus, dass alles, was Schöningen vorgelegt hat, auch in die Akten eingegangen ist. Das entscheidet nicht Schöningen.Notz: Aber die Akten-Aufforderungen zu unseren Beweisbeschlüssen ging über seinen Schreibtisch. Unsere Aktenlage ist dünn. Wie viele Prozent des Materials von dort haben wir?Wolff: Kann ich nicht sagen. Ich habe nicht gesehen, was Schöningen geliefert hat. Die Außenstellen haben die Tendenz, sehr breit vorzulegen. Die Entscheidung treffen aber andere.Notz: Die Bundesregierung legt das anders aus. Uns haben nur vier Seiten erreicht.Wolff: Inhalte, die nicht den Untersuchungsgegenstand betreffen, geben wir ihnen nicht.Sensburg: Ist Gegenstand einer Beratungssitzung.Notz: Ist nicht der langweiligste Tag mit Herrn E. B. Eine Milliarde Daten pro Jahr alleine in Schöningen.Wolff: Nicht an Five Eyes Staaten, nicht Untersuchungsgegenstand.Notz: Bei uns kamen vier dünne Seitchen an. Der Zeuge weiß genau, worum es im Ausschuss geht und antwortet auch so. Wie viele Seiten haben sie geschickt?Eisenberg: Ist geheim. Der Zeuge darf keine geheimen Akten vorlegen, also darf er auch nicht darüber berichten.[Gelächter bei der Opposition.]E. B.: Ein dick gefüllter Ordner.Notz: So 300 Seiten?E. B.: Ja. War alles, quasi wahlfrei genommen, was sein könnte. Wir hatten keinen juristischen Beistand, zu entscheiden, ob das dazu gehört.Notz: Bei uns kam ein Prozent an. Schließen sie aus, dass Daten, die sie an die Bundeswehr leiten, auch in Force Protection Pools landen?E. B.: Kann ich nicht ausschließen. Aber Bundeswehr geht sehr sorgfältig damit um.- Notz: Konstantin von Notz, MdB, Bündnis 90 die Grünen; Sensburg:  Patrick Sensburg, MdB, Ausschussvorsitzender, CDU; Wolff: Phillip Wolff, BundeskanzleramtDer gute Herr Wolff dürfte so einigen Vorsprung vor den Abgeordneten haben, was das Wissen um die Antworten auf den Untersuchungsauftrag betrifft. Die Abgeordneten erhalten vom BND nur soviel wie gerade nötig und hangeln sich anhand von Presseberichten und geleakten Dokumenten am Thema entlang, ihnen wird nur ein relativ kleiner, enger Ausschnitt präsentiert. Man merkt den Fragen an, dass nach Monaten von Ausschussarbeit, die Abgeordneten von BND-Beamten keine volle Kooperation erwarten. Es gleicht dem Versuch einen Pudding an die Wand zu nageln. Ob die Antwort nun eingestuft sei, eine andere Abteilung dafür zuständig sei oder auch man einfach nie von etwas gewusst habe, es ist eine Lektion in 1001 Ausflüchten. Und das, obwohl das Bundesverfassungsgericht bereits einer Klage gegen, durch die Regierung erstellte, sehr restriktive Aussagegenehmigungen für die Zeugen stattgab.Fazit: Der Besuch des Ausschusses lohnt trotz allem, da es leider keine andere Möglichkeit gibt die Zwischentöne und Schattierungen so deutlich mitzubekommen. Man erfährt eine Menge über die Funktions- und Denkweise der Geheimdienste, die ihren Tätigkeiten ja sonst nur in punkto Öffentlichkeit schattigen Ecken nachgehen. Es gibt ja auch böse Zungen, die behaupten jede Demokratie habe einen weißen Fleck: Den Geheimdienst. Die langen Pausen bei kritischen Fragen, die dem Maulkorb für die BND-Beamten geschuldet sind, lassen auch bei klug gestellten Fragen Schlüsse zu, die spätere Antworten im nicht-öffentlichen Teil vorwegnehmen. Hier darf man besonders Grünen und Linken dankbar sein, die auch im öffentlichen Teil reichlich Fragen Stellen, während CDU/CSU und SPD sich mit dem Fragenstellen eher auf den nicht-öffentlichen Teil zu konzentrieren scheinen.",

        "content": "Wie immer (etwas angemessener: seit dem letzten Blogeintrag) vorher die Liste mit den Dingen die man (bloß nicht in einer Reisegruppe, außer man betreibt Meta-Massentourismus und will sehen, wie schlechter Tourismus in China aussieht) machen sollte:Löwenhaingarten (Shī Zǐ Lín Yuán, meine Übersetzung ist da etwas holprig) besichtigenDas Ehemalige Fischerdorf Zhouzhuang besuchenDen lokalen Tempel in Suzhou besichtigenDa meine Mutter auf die verwegene Idee kam, eine Pauschalreise bei einem lokalen Reisebüro zu buchen, kam ich in den Genuss eines Einblicks in die chinesische Version von Inlandstourismus. Mit erschreckenden Entdeckungen. Los ging es mit einem Kleintransporter in die nächst größere Stadt. Abgesehen von der Zurschaustellung eines bizarren Musikgeschmacks seitens des Fahrers (Scooter meets China…) gab es soweit noch keine Auffälligkeiten. Am Haltepunkt angekommen, mussten wir in einen Bus wechseln, welcher uns zur wiederum nächst größeren Stadt bringen würde. Schon beim Einsteigen kam einem ein Stoß lauwarmer und bestialisch stinkender Luft entgegen. Es roch, wie in einem Luchskäfig, einem lange nicht mehr gereinigtem Luchskäfig. Aber man gewöhnt sich an alles. Nach einer Stunde waren wir dann endlich in Wuxi und durften wieder den Bus wechseln (Anm. d. Red.: Wer Rekursion verstehen will, muss erst einmal Rekursion verstanden haben). Diesmal stieg eine zierliche Reiseleiterin mit einer so gar nicht zur Zierlichkeit passenden schmerzend-schrillen Stimme zu und redete ohne Unterlass durch die zu lauten Bordlautsprecher auf die Fahrgäste ein. Eine geschlagene Stunde lang. Doch die Chinesen schien das wenig zu stören, für sie schien es das normalste der Welt zu sein. Abgesehen davon, dass die Reiseleiterin fleischgewordene Inkompetenz zu sein schien, tat sie sich ebenfalls dadurch hervor, dass sie mehrere Fahrgäste aus Shanghai, welche sich über die schlechte Organisation beschwert hatten, durch die Lautsprecher herabsetzte. “Schaut her, diese tollen Shanghaier aus der Großstadt sollten doch Vorbilder für alle sein und sich nicht so benehmen. Großstädter sind doch zivilisierte Menschen.” Doch diese Brüskierung war das sprichwörtliche Öl ins Feuer gießen und resultierte nun in eine ernsthafte Auseinandersetzung mit der Reiseleiterin.Wie dem auch sei, in Suzhou, der Geburtsstadt des auch im Westen für sein Werk bekannten Sun Zi angekommen,  fuhren wir als erstes zu der Attraktion überhaupt: Dem Löwengarten (chin.: Shī Zǐ Lín Yuán) . Dass dieser Garten Teil des UNESCO-Welterbe ist, spricht Bände. Er ist einer der rund 60 Gärten Suzous. Der Garten wurde vor vielen hundert Jahren von Mönchen angelegt und sogar der Kaiser ließ sich eine Replik anlegen, weil er von der Schönheit des Gartens überwältigt war. Der Garten selbst ist ein Kleinod der Landschaftsbaukunst. Er ist voll und ganz künstlich angelegt und enthält Felsformationen, Teiche, Brücken und Pflanzen, wie sie nur einem klassischen chinesischen Gedichtband entsprungen sein können. Man kann sich in den künstlichen Grotten und Trampelpfaden verlaufen oder den Garten von der ihm säumenden, gediegenen Veranda aus betrachten. Durch die Fenster sind Wasser, Felsen und Pflanzen oftmals wie für ein Gemälde arrangiert. Komposition, Farbe und Symbolik nach könnte es genau so gut eine alte Landschaftszeichnung handeln und das imposante ist, dass eben dieser Eindruck, Stein für Stein, gezielt konstruiert wurde. Ein wundervoller Ort, dem ein ganz eigener Zauber innewohnt, so könnte man es theatralisch zusammenfassen. Wer in der Gegend ist, sollte es sich ansehen – in echt noch schöner als auf den Bildern:Danach wurde es erst richtig spannend, nein nicht die belanglose Bootsfahrt die als nächstes auf dem Programm stand; gemeint ist ein Einblick in die chinesische Tourismus-Mafia, so will ich es einmal bezeichnen. Während der Bootsfahrt fiel bereits auf, dass unsere - ich möchte noch einmal ihre völlige Unzulänglichkeit in jeder Hinsicht betonen - Reiseleiterin auf der Bootsfahrt plötzlich anfing davon zu sprechen, wie großartig Seidendecken seien und was für ein tolles Geschenk es doch für die Daheimgebliebenen sei. Eine knappe Stunde erging sie sich in der Preisung von Seidenware, was den Grund hatte, dass der nächste Programmpunkt die Besichtigung einer “Seidenfabrik” (Man beachte die Anführungszeichen) war. Natürlich handelte es sich nicht um eine Seidenfabrik, sondern um einen zweistöckigen Verkaufspunkt für Seidenbettdecken, -kleidung, Topflappen und noch mehr Tand und Tinnef. Es war eine Museumssimulation mit angeschlossenem Verkaufsbereich. Der Treppenwitz hierbei: Wir hatten eine 2-Tages-Tour gebucht und am nächsten Tag fuhren wir mit einer anderen Reiseleiterin gleich noch ein weiteres Mal zur altbekannten Touristenfalle. Auch hier bietet sich wieder der Vergleich mit dem Email-Spam im echten Leben an. Bei tausend Touristen reicht es, wenn es 10 Dumme oder sagen wir besser Arglose gibt. Nur, dass die neue Reiseleiterin ihre Gäste nicht wie Vollidioten behandelte und offen sagte, dass sie dafür eine hohe Provision erhalte. Auch sonst war diese Leiterin erstaunlich offen zu uns, doch dazu später mehr.Nun zurück zu Tag 1, denn der fing grade erst an, insgesamt sollten noch 3! weitere Touristenfallen, maximal lustlos als drittklassiges Museum verkappt, folgen. Insgesamt also stolze 4 Stück an einem Tag. Dem Fass den Boden schlug dabei Station 3 aus: das “Perlen-Forschungsinstitut”, an welchem man mit der Reisegruppe in einen kleinen Raum geführt wurde, in welchem man von einer resoluten, klein gewachsenen Mittsechzigerin geistig bearbeitet wurde. Manch böse Zunge würde auch sagen: Gehirngewaschen. Scharlatanerie ist dabei noch die freundlichste Bezeichnung, welche mir dazu einfallen will. Sie zog wahrlich alle Register der Agitprop, von der Behauptung Perlenpulver bekämpfe Krebs bis hin zur präventiven Wirkung in Bezug auf Hämorrhoiden. In Deutschland strafbar, in China eine von vielen wahrheitswidrigen Behauptungen zur Verkaufsförderung. Nach der “Informationsvermittlung” wurde man in die endlos langen Kaufbereiche entlassen, wo doch tatsächlich einige aus der Reisegruppe das angepriesene Perlenpulver erwarben. Später, als wir meiner Tante von dieser Praxis (Pauschalreisende zu belügen und in Verkaufshallen und überteuerte Restaurants zu karren) erzählten, meinte diese, dass die Situation jetzt schon deutlich besser sei. Es gäbe Verbraucherschutzrechte, weshalb man nun auch frei sei, nichts zu kaufen. Früher habe man die Leute zum Kaufen gezwungen: Wer nichts kauft, landet am Straßenrand. Oder der Reiseführer holt gleich ein Messer aus der Taschen und schwingt dieses dräuend, als verkaufsfördernde Maßnahme. Wir seien wohl einer fake-Reiseagentur aufgesessen. Es gäbe auch richtige. Auch hier zeigt sich einmal mehr, dass man in fremden Städten besser “Locals” kennen und diese fragen sollte, bevor man einer wohlbekannten Idiotenfalle anheimfällt. Es gibt genug Leute, die auf Dummenfang gehen, man darf sich nur nicht allzu leicht zur Beute machen. Reisen ist in China für den Unerfahrenen durchaus ein Vanbanquespiel.&ldquo;Perlenpulver beugt Krebs vor und verhindert Hämorrhoiden&rdquo;Die Reiseveranstalter müssen in der Tat einer mafiösen Struktur angehören. Das fragwürdigste Vorkommnis, war die Fahrt zu einem “Restaurant” im Nirgendwo, in welchem man essen musste, da anderes zu weit weg sei und der Bus auch schon in 40min losfahren würde. Dort zahlte man für sehr schlechtes Essen (Die meisten ließen 80% davon zurück) mindestens 100 Yuan, also ca. 12 Euro. Für chinesische Verhältnisse ein sehr teurer Preis. Zu viert kostet ein Besuch in einem sehr guten Restaurant in der Regel etwa 200 Yuan. Bei der niederen Essensqualität dürfte der Reingewinn eingedenk der chinesischen Personalkosten bei 80 Prozent liegen (reine Schätzung). Der große Strippenzieher im Hintergrund dürfte ein abgefeimter, gut vernetzter Mann sein, der nur wenig Skrupel hat. Die Bedienungen, mit ihren verlebten Gesichtern, sind jedenfalls auch ein Opfer des Systems. Es ist wirklich eine Unsäglichkeit. In unserer Reisegruppe waren etwa 40 Personen und es waren noch 2 weitere Busse zu sehen. Legt man zu Grunde, dass konservativ geschätzt immer 4 Personen zusammen das billigste Menü wählen, kommen so pro Stunde 120 x 100 Yuan = 12000 Yuan zusammen. Also gut 72000 Yuan am Tag bei 6h Betrieb. Macht also gut 10.000 Euro Umsatz am Tag und etwa 4 Millionen im Jahr. Und das ist wohlgemerkt die konservative Schätzung! Es ist also eine riesige Geldmenge und ich würde mich wundern, wenn der Betreiber nicht gute Verbindungen zur lokalen Politik hat. Denn soviel Umsatz mit so windigen Methoden macht man sicherlich nicht ohne bei gewissen Funktionären auf lieb Kind zu machen (Auch wieder nur geraten, es ist allerdings schwer vorstellbar, dass die Funktionäre vor Ort die mafiöse Tourismusbranche einfach so übersehen). Die chinesische Binnentourismusindustrie ist mit der integralen Mittelschicht erschaffen worden und so ist die Struktur dieses Marktes womöglich nicht nur Manifestation der chinesischen Turbokapitalismusmentalität, sondern auch die der (noch) fehlenden Marktregulierung durch den Staat beziehungsweise dessen Überforderung damit.Am nächsten Tag zeigte die neue Reiseleiterin, dass es auch besser geht. Es ging in ein kleines Fischerdörfchen. Sie sprach offen an, dass sie etwa von der “Seidenfabrik” eine Provision erhält oder, dass sie vom Restaurantbesitzer eine Provision erhält und es stünde uns auch frei woanders hinzugehen. Am Ende des Tages erwähnte sie noch, dass sie im Haus — bzw. genauer gesagt — in der Villa des Restaurantbesitzers war. Es war eine der teuersten Villen in der Gegend des ehemaligen Fischerdörfchens (aka. Das Venedig Chinas). Die Reiseleiterin berichtete von einem Wortwechsel, welcher sich folgendermaßen zutrug: Reiseleiterin: Das ist aber ein schönes Schränkchen, war es teuer? Restaurantbesitzer: Sie stellen die falsche Frage, fragen sie besser aus welcher Dynastie es stammt. Es ist schwer zu fassen, wie man mit dem Konzept lächerlich schlechtes Essen in einem heruntergekommenen Schuppen zu absurden Preisen wirtschaften kann. Dem Geschäftsmodell liegt zugrunde, dass die “Kunden” bzw. korrekter die Opfer eben nur einmal in den Ort kommen und danach nie wieder. Daher investiert der Betreiber auch nichts, sonder schöpft einfach seinen Anteil am Gewinn vom Touristenstrom ab. Weiter berichtete uns die Reiseleiterin, dass das normale Gehalt für die Dorfbewohner bei etwa 3000 Yuan, also gut 400 Euro läge und die sehr guten Jobs seien mit einem Salär von 7000 Yuan, also etwa 900 Euro, versehen. Nicht inkludiert in diese Betrachtungen sind natürlich die Besitzer der “Restaurants” und der anderen Verkaufseinrichtungen im Fischerdörfchen. Hier zeigt sich wieder einmal mehr, dass die Ungleichheit in China extrem ist. Über Nacht wurden die Besitzer von Immobilien an prominenter Stelle zu Millionären und andere wurden zu deren willfährigen Gehilfen, wobei das meiste Geld an sehr wenige Leute geht. Das Dorf ist zwar eine Reise wert, jedoch macht die zwanghafte Monetarisierung von allem und jedem aus einem authentischen Fischerdorf, welches ein altes, längst überholtes China erlebbar machen kann, ein unanständig-geldfixiertes Disneyland. Dazu lässt sich auch noch nahtlos auf das millionenschwere — und offenbar in ernsthaften Finanzierungsschwierigkeiten steckende — Taiwandorf verweisen. Es liegt nahe dem Fischerdorf und soll eine  Art Moviepark zum Thema Taiwan sein. Es krankt an maroder Bausubstanz und einem unschlüssigen Konzept, weshalb der Eintritt für uns auch kostenlos war. Geplant war eine Eröffnung 2010. Man wollte den Tourismusstrom zum Fischerdorf ausnutzen und gleich in das Taiwandorf lenken, um noch mehr Gewinn erzielen zu können. Doch auch hier scheitert die Gewinnsucht am Fehlen der Substanz. Auf Dauer nur schnell Geld zu machen ist suizidal und wird das Dörfchen ohne Abweichen vom Kurs irgendwann in die Irrelevanz katapultieren. Aber China hat viele Menschen und Warnungen scheinen sich nicht schnell genug herumzusprechen.Die unzulängliche ReiseleiterinDie intelligente Reiseleiterin",

        "content": "Shanghai ist größer, schneller, diverser, rücksichtsloser, schriller, kitschiger, kontrastreicher und fremder als die meisten anderen Städte — dachte ich, bis ich in eine andere Stadt in China gekommen bin. Aber man kann zum Mindesten behaupten, dass die Aussage beschränkt auf größere Weltstädte zutrifft. Die brennendste Frage lautet wahrscheinlich: Was sollte man sich in Shanghai umbedingt ansehen, was muss man erlebt haben? Während meiner Woche dort habe ich viel tolles und noch mehr eher unnötiges erlebt. Hier also gleich zu Anfang für die ungeduldigen Leser die Liste der “Muss man gemacht haben”-Dinge, die “Muss man nicht gemacht haben”-Liste lasse ich aus Platzspargründen weg:Einmal mit dem Maglev bzw. Transrapid fahren (optional das Maglev-Museum für Technikaffinere und man sollte auf die Uhrzeiten achten da er nur zu best. Zeiten 430km/h fährt)Einmal am Fuße eines Wolkenkratzers im Finance-Distrikt stehenEinfach essen auf der Huanghe Road 黄河路 (huáng hé lù) (Exit 8, Metrostation Huanghe Road)Auf smartshanghai.com vorbeischauen: etwa hier.Mit dem Fahrrad durch Shanghai fahren (Adrenalin garantiert)Eislaufen im Mercedes Benz Stadium (Wenn man Eislaufen mag)Eine Theateraufführung besuchen. Link.Mal in der Power Station Of Art vorbeischauen Sich an der Marxismus-Fakultät der Tongji-Universität einschreiben Teurer Essen im “wai pi jia”/Grandma’s home: Smartshaghai hat es auch auf dem Radar  oder auch hier rezensiert.Wer&rsquo;s mag: Clubbing (Myst/M2, es ist m.E. musikalisch grauenhaft, da kostenlos, aber durchaus probierenswert. Vom famosen M1nt  hingegen habe ich leider erst zu spät erfahren)Billig Essen in der Unikantine kann man auch mal machen, ich vermittle gerne einen Kontaktstudenten in Shanghai, ansonsten bietet hierfür auch Couchsurfing anDie Studentbar Perry&rsquo;s aufsuchen (Die Pizza ist gut, der Rest auf eigene Gefahr!)Nerdtipp: Die C-Base ShanghaisAuch wenn es nicht mein erstes Mal in China generell und Shanghai im speziellen war, fühlte es sich doch fast so an. Das letze mal in China war ich im Alter von 13 Jahren. Ich erinnere mich noch dunkel, daher blieb wahrscheinlich der jähe Kulturschock aus und es stellen sich stattdessen leichte Kulturschockmomente ein, welche aber schnell verfliegen.Das erste was einem wahrscheinlich auffallen wird, nachdem sich der Staub des anfänglichen Trubels gelegt hat und man die offensichtlichen Unterschiede, wie die exotischen Zeichen und die so anders klingende Sprache verarbeitet hat, ist die andere Mentalität der Menschen. Dies wird am offensichtlichsten manifest, wenn man mit der U-Bahn fährt: Die einsteigenden Fahrgäste drängen ohne Zögern in das Abteil und so ergibt sich bei hohem Fahrgastaufkommen auch schon mal die eine oder andere Kollision beim Ein- und Aussteigen. Ein weiteres Phänomen welchem man in der U-Bahn ausgesetzt ist, ist der Real-Life-E-Mail-Spam. Klingt komisch, is’ aber so. Nun was verbirgt sich hinter dieser gewiss fantasievollen Wortneuschöpfung? Auf manchen Strecken geht eine junges Frau oder ein junger Mann durch alle Züge und verteilt kleine Papierflyer mit Werbung für Reisen (perfide als Streckenplan getarnt, aber als solcher unbrauchbar). In ihr Smartphone vertieften Passagieren wird der Flyer flugs auf den Schoß gelegt, ablehnend die Hände Hebenden ebenso flugs gekonnt auf den Schoß geschleudert. Insgesamt kann man mit diesen Paradebeispiel das Bild des rücksichtsloseren Chinas skizzieren, was sich an anderer Stelle auch wiederfindet. In China zählt die Familiengemeinschaft sehr, die Gesellschaft, die allgemeine Gemeinschaft eher weniger. Daher haben die Chinesen auch einen leistungsstarken Filter im Kopf, um mit den gebetsmühlenhaftigen Lautsprecheransprachen in Läden, absolut lächerlich geschmacklosen Platzbeschallungen und den aufdringlichen Privat-Taxifahren umzugehen. Insbesondere bewundere ich eine meiner Tanten, welche so unbeeindruckt und abgebrüht ist, dass sie nichts aus der Bahn wirft. Wenn ich ihr mit Unverständnis von einer für mich unglaublich absurden Sache berichte, zuckt sie nur mit den Schultern: In China ist es eben so. China sei nun mal kaputt und es geht drunter und drüber. (“Je li hen luan de!”).Ursprünglich wollte ich umbedingt in Shanghai Couchsurfen, da sich das aber als schwierig herausstellte, musste ich auf das Appartement meiner Cousine 2. Grades ausweichen. Das sicher nicht allzu preiswerte Appartement bringt mich zum nächsten Punkt: Man kann das zweistellige Wirtschaftswachstum über die letzten Jahre tatsächlich sehen! Ich vermute, dass etwas ähnliches gemeint ist, wenn ältere davon sprechen, dass man in den 70ern stets wusste, dass es einem nächstes Jahr besser gehen würde. Man wusste es eben, weil man sehen konnte, wie alles über die Jahre besser wurde. Dazu braucht man nicht die Statistiken lesen, welche einem Aufschluss darüber geben, dass Chinas Wirtschaft in den letzten 10 Jahren jährlich um etwa 10 Prozent gewachsten ist und das Durchschnittseinkommen sich verzwanzigfacht hat. Nein, vielmehr reicht es aus, sich die Autos auf den Straßen, die Wohnungen, die Smartphones der Menschen und die Preise anzuschauen. In Chinas größeren Städten dürften ebenso viele Menschen ein iPhone besitzen, wie in den USA. Überhaupt ist es bemerkenswert wie viele Fake-Apple-Stores (mit echten iPhones) es überall gibt. Allerdings ist es auch so, dass der Reichtum (wie so oft) sich an der Reichtumsspitze deutlich stärker zunimmt, als am unteren Ende der Skala. So besitzt das reichste Ein-Prozent der Bevölkerung mehr als 33 Prozent des Vermögens. In Deutschland sind es immerhin auch etwa 23 Prozent des Gesamtvermögens, welche das oberste Prozent besitzt. Auch der Gini-Koeffizient in China zeigt mit 0.77 eine bedenkliche Ungleichgewichtigkeit im sozialen an. Irgendwann merken die Leute die immense Ungleichverteilung, wenn es zu offensichtlich wird. Shanghai illustriert dies recht gut, dort ist es bereits relativ offensichtlich. Wenn man etwa beim Essenstand um die Ecke ein “Baozi” für 15 Yuan, also knapp 20 Cent erhält und von dem dadurch erwirtschafteten Gewinn eine ganze Familie leben muss. Mein schlechtes Gewissen zwang mich schließlich auch mehr zu bezahlen, aber das lehnte die Verkäuferin vehement ab.Shanghai ist, das kann man sagen, ohne sich allzu weit aus dem Fenster zu lehnen, noch relativ westlich. Dennoch konnte ich mir das eine oder andere Mal nicht ein Schmunzeln verkneifen, wenn ich ein Touristenpärchen beim Scheitern an einer Speisekarte beobachten konnte. In Shanghai passiert es sehr schnell, dass man von der großen Einkaufsstraße abbiegt und in ärmlichen Umgebungen landet und die soziale Ungleichheit in krasser Weise fühlbar macht. Was denken die Leute dort, wenn der reiche Westler oder der noch reichere Chinese in Kleidung, die mehr Kostet, als sie im Jahr verdienen, vorbeiflaniert? Ich kann es mir nur schwer vorstellten. Vielleicht denken sie sich ja: Meinen Kindern bzw. meinem Kind soll es einmal besser gehen, es soll (finanziell) erfolgreich sein. Überhaupt merkt man, dass China ein materialistischeres Land ist, als etwa das, sich im Vergleich, fast schon postmaterialistisch ausnehmende Deutschland.Zudem konnte man noch erfahren, dass Westler so etwas ähnliches, wie Pandas zu sein scheinen. Eine seltene Art, die es zu umsorgen gilt, da sie eine Art Attraktion ist. So wurde mir erzählt, dass in manchen Clubs in abgelegeneren Städten Westler grundsätzlich freien Eintritt und Freigetränke erhalten. Auch merkt man, dass viele gerne “im Westen” leben würden. Auch das ist sicherlich eine Herausforderung für das Land: Attraktiv für seine Bürger zu bleiben.  Jedenfalls ist Shanghai ein Ort, der nicht repräsentativ für China ist, jedoch sicherlich auf einer Reise nicht fehlen sollte. Wie auch immer, hier noch ein paar Bilder:Die ubiquitäre Standard-Shanghai-Besuchs-Aufnahme darf auch hier nicht fehlen!Kulturunterschiede verdeutlichen sich immer auch an der Andersartigkeit der Produkte z.B. Lebensmittel.Du hast Angst vor Menschenmassen? Tipp: Suche ein anderes Reiseziel aus.Nein, das sind keine Demokratieproteste, die ich &ldquo;auf Film gebannt habe&rdquo;.

        "title": "Freitag in Oxford",
        "author": "",
        "category": "travel",
        "content": "Da es sich zufälligerweise so ergab, dass an der Oxford University der “open day” für “undergraduate admissions” stattfand, stand es außer Frage, dass wir (Cihan &amp; moi) nicht dort hin fahren (Disclaimer: Nicht aufgrund intellektueller Eigenschaften, sondern vielmehr der Neugier wegen). Am morgen ging es gegen 10 nach Oxford. Eigentlich wusste ich nicht besonders viel; weder über die Stadt, noch über die Universität. Nun, eine Eliteuni soll es sein und viele Szenen aus Harry Potter wurden in Oxford gedreht.Angekommen erblickt man sogleich auch die allenthalben aufgestellten &ldquo;University of Oxford&rdquo;-Fahnen, die zum &ldquo;open day&rdquo; auf die Unizugehörigkeit der Gebäude hinweist. Oxford ist ein etwa mittelgroßes Städtchen und die Uni-Institutionen durziehen sie wie Fettstreifen ein gutes Qualitätssteak. Als erstes möchte ich unbedingt das Balliol-College sehen, welches auch das College von Richard Dawnkins war. Eine Nachfrage im Information Center führt zu einer hilfreichen Wegbeschreibung und so machen wir uns auf den Weg.Das Balliol-College ist eines der Colleges in Oxford, von denen es Legion gibt. Wenn man in Oxford studiert, dann bewirbt man sich nicht bei der Universität, sondern bei einem der Colleges. Die Colleges stellen auch Unterkunft, Finanzierung und die Tutoren für die Studenten zur Verfügung. Die Vorlesungen und Prüfungen hingegen werden von den jeweiligen Fakultäten der Universität organisiert, welche einem nachher auch den begehrten Abschluss verleihen. Während des ganzen Tages betonen alle mit denen wir sprechen, dass es zwar eine nicht ganz Ernst gemeinte Rivalität zwischen den Colleges gebe, aber im Endeffekt wäre es egal für welches College man sich entscheide, da alle exzellent sind. Im Balliol-College angekommen, lässt sich erst einmal sagen: Es sieht wirklich aus, wie in den Harry Potter Filmen. Die Gänge, die Höfe, die Türmchen auf den Dächern, die verwinkelten Gänge und Wendeltreppen. Da ein grade &ldquo;admissions talk&rdquo; im Gange ist, lassen wir uns von einem Studenten in das entsprechende Zimmer geleiten. Auf dem Weg erzählt uns dieser, dass er die Uni toll findet und wie wir es noch so oft an diesem Tag hören sollen, dass eigentlich alle Colleges gut seien, aber wir uns am besten doch für seines entscheiden sollten. Schließlich nach einer kurzen Weile (ein Gang über den malerischen Innenhof ist nun wirklich nicht der schlechteste Zeitvertreib) kommen wir in einem kleinen Zimmer an und zu meinem Erstaunen sitzen dort nur gut 6 andere im Kreis an dessen Kopf ein Mittvierziger gebildet wirkender Tutor des Colleges sitzt. Wie wir später noch erfahren sollten, handelte es sich um Professor Tom Melham. Neben allgemeinen Informationen über das Bewerbungsverfahren, betonte Melham immer wieder: “We need to know, that you have enough brain power” oder auch “In the interview we will test if your brain muscle is strong enough”. Besteht man nämlich die schriftliche Bewerbungsauswahl, wird man vom jeweiligen Tutor des Colleges interviewt. Da dieser mit der Aussicht die Hand voll ausgewählte Studenten über die nächsten drei Jahre betreuen zu müssen, will dieser natürlich nur die bestgeeignetesten Studenten. So ließ Melham uns immer wieder wissen: “You need to love computer science. Or else it won’t make sense. You have to do what you really love.” Am Ende komme es auf drei Dinge an: Mann muss ein guter Student sein. Man muss die Motivation haben. Mann muss die notwendige Intelligenz vorweisen. Ferner gibt es keine Nationalquoten, es werden schlicht die geeignetsten Bewerber ausgewählt.Nach dieser schon leicht einschüchternden Vorstellung ging es dann zur Fakultät für Informatik. Diese lag einige hundert Meter vom College entfernt, was bei der Schönheit Oxfords aber nicht unangenehm ist, eher im Gegenteil.In echt noch schöner: Balliol CollegeDas muss dann wohl dieser Englische Rasen sein, von dem immer alle Welt spricht&hellip;Die Fakultät ist selbstredend auch in einem stilvollen Gebäude untergebrachten und liegt neben der überraschend hässlichen Physikfakultät. Die Fakultät ist verwinkelt und kompakt. Es gibt nur zwei Vorlesungssäle. Der größer von ihnen fasst maximal etwa 50 Personen. Daran lässt sich schon erahnen mit welchem Betreuer zu Studenten Schlüssel hier gearbeitet wird. Hier kennt der Professor alle Studenten beim Namen. Das gibt es an deutschen Unis eher weniger. In der Fakultät haben Studenten aus dem 3. Jahr ihre Semesterprojekte zur Schau gestellt. Es sind beachtliche Projekte zu sehen, grade wenn man bedenkt, dass diese in nur 8 Wochen entstanden sind. Die Studenten sind, diese Bewertung maße ich mir einfach einmal an, durch und durch Vollnerds. In den Gesprächen erfahren wir, dass das Studium in Oxford vor allem auf die theoretischen Grundlagen setzt. So lernt man als erste Programmiersprache auch nicht Java o.Ä., sondern Hascall. Grund hierfür ist die Nützlichkeit der Sprache bei der Veranschaulichung von grundlegenden Prinzipien von Programmierung. Praktisches Programmieren steht eher weniger auf dem Lehrplan. Wer die Theorie wirklich durchdrungen und verstanden hat, kann jedes Problem mit ein wenig einlesen lösen lautet das Prinzip dahinter. Alles in allem ist die Fakultät erstaunlich schlicht gehalten. Bei einem solch großen Namen, wie Oxford erwartet man unwillkürlich etwas mehr Extravaganz, aber nichts dergleichen ist zu finden. Beim Verlassen der Fakultät fällt noch das Poster von Google auf, welches Studenten für Praktika wirbt.Echt hässlich: Physikfakultät.Die Informatikfakultät.Für die Zweifler hier noch das Schild. Es muss stimmen. Es steht immerhin auf einem Schild!Der größere der 2 VorlesungssäleDer schlichte AufenthaltsraumDas schwarze Brett an meiner Uni sieht irgendwie weniger hochkarätig aus ;(Auch in Oxford langweilig: Flur.Insgesamt sind die Berufschancen der Absolventen glänzend. Einer der Tutoren erzählt uns, dass die Uni über ein spezielles Büro bei der Berufsvermittlung hilft und es mehr Stellenangebote als Studenten gibt. Die Nachfrage nach Absolventen sei sogar so groß, dass die Uni einfach Stellengesuche unterhalb eines bestimmten Gehalts schlankweg ablehnt. Alle großen Internetkonzerne nehmen die Studenten mit offenen Armen auf, sei es Google, Amazon oder auch Yahoo.Der nächste Punkt auf unserem Tagesprogramm war der “undergraduate talk” der Archäologiefakultät. Die Größe des einzigen Hörsaals dürfte so einigen die Sprache verschlagen: Der Hörsaal ist nicht größer als mein Zimmer. Es ist eigentlich ein Wohnzimmer mit einem Kamin an der Front, vielen Büchern in Regalen, einer Weltkarte und einer Tafel an der Front. Mit maximal 20 Studenten in einer Vorlesung gleicht das geradezu Einzelunterricht. Auch hier plaudert der Professor aus dem Nähkästchen. Ein alerter und charismatischer Mittfünfziger, der mit Anekdoten und Späßen die Zuhörer zu bannen weiß. Der Professor betont, dass in der archäologischen Fakultät das Betreuer-Studenten-Verhältnis das geringste in ganz Oxford ist. Generell erklärt, der Professor, dass man im Gegensatz zu anderen Unis keine Sprechzeiten braucht, da man bei Fragen einfach Abends an der Wohnungstür des Professors oder Tutors anklopfen kann und dieser dann die Fragen oder Probleme durchgehen wird. Es wird kein Zweifel daran gelassen, dass Oxford die beste Bildungseinrichtung weit und breit ist. Man kann hier jeglichen akademischen Interessen folgen. Ob Sprachkurse oder noch zusätzliche Physik- und Ökonomievorlesungen, man werde in jedem Fall von der Universität voll unterstützt. Auch hier sind die Hürden selbstverständlich hoch: “In your reference your teacher has to tell me why you are the best student he has ever met.” heißt es lapidar als Antwort auf die Frage, wie denn das Referenzschreiben auszusehen hat. Zudem komme es auf die akademische Qualifikation an und nicht auf Dinge wie etwa soziales Engagement.Am Ende gab es noch eine Führung die ein weiterer Tutor leitete. Dieser war auch studierter Archäologe und erforscht zur Zeit, wie man aus fossilen Überresten von Lebewesen die Umweltbedingungen in der Vergangenheit rekonstruieren kann. Sei es mit DNA-Analyse oder sonstigen Verfahren. Definitiv ein Feld, an welches man beim Wort Archäologie nicht als erstes denkt. Die Führung verlief daher auch in die Physikfakultät, wo wir den weltweit präzisesten Apparat zur C-14 Altersbestimmung bestaunen durften (Momentan +- 50 Jahre). Hier wurden schon diverse Gegenstände datiert, die hohe Wellen in den Medien schlugen. Das DNA-Labor war weniger beeindruckend, aber nichtsdestoweniger interessant. Insgesamt hat die Tour verdeutlicht, welche Rolle Interdisziplinarität in Oxford spielt. Es war auch ein Augenöffner dafür, wie breit das Spektrum von Archäologie als wissenschaftliche Disziplin sein kann.Krass: Ancient DNA laboratoryKrasser: Oxford-Physiker (links)Zu guter letzt ging es ein weiteres Mal in die Informatikfakultät. Dort wurde ein Interview simuliert, wie es Bewerber zu durchlaufen haben. Der Professor gibt hierbei eine Problemstellung vor und gibt dem Bewerber Hinweise zur Lösung. Das Beispiel war, dass einer der Hochpunkte einer beliebigen Funktion bestimmt werden sollte, wobei man dies ermitteln musste, indem man maximal 10 Punkte abfragt. Nach und nach sollte man eine geeignete möglichst effiziente Methode finden, was der Student aus dem 2. Jahr auch schaffte (der sich vorher Freiwillig als Testkaninchen zur Verfügung gestellt hatte). Weiter erfahren wir, dass im letzten Jahr fünf Bewerber hintereinander behauptet haben, dass die Summe der natürlichen Zahlenfolge die Fakultät sei, erzählt der Professor sichtlich amüsiert.Am Abend fahren wir wieder und zurück bleibt der schale Beigeschmack des Verdachts, dass es an der eigenen Uni einiges gibt, was besser organisiert sein könnte. Verständlich ist, dass Oxford kein unbegrenzt skalierbares Modell ist, allein schon der Kosten wegen. Oxford ist eine Insel der Seligen für Studierende und Forschende, da könnte sich so manche deutsche Uni das eine oder andere abschauen, etwa, dass die Professoren und Tutoren die Bewerber persönlich filtern und so nicht schon gleich die Hälfte im ersten Semester abbricht.",

        "content": "Nach einer unerfreulichen Episode mit dem Geldautomaten am Flughafen (kryptokommunist.tumblr.com berichtete) ging es mit dem Bus zum Hostel. Auch hier darf nicht unerwähnt bleiben, dass die grandiose Errungenschaft des 21. Jahrhunderts namens Internet eine ungemeine Vereinfachung darstellte. Dank WiFi im Bus ließ es sich spielend leicht erfahren, wie wir von der Haltestelle am schnellsten zum Hostel kommen. Selbiges Erlebnis ist in einem deutschen ICE für dessen Fahrt ich regulär 100 Euro zahlen müsste nicht zu bekommen (Außer man schließt einen Knebelvertrag mit der Telekom ab).Das Hostel selbst war über einem Pub angesiedelt und besaß einen gewissen “englischen” Charme. Alles ist recht eng und verwinkelt, das Personal besitzt einen trockenen britischen Humor und zum Frühstück gibt es Brot mit Marmelade. Die Lage ist auch recht zentral, circa 30 Minuten vom Zentrum entfernt. Hinzu kommt noch der (für die Gäste) erfreuliche Umstand, dass dem Pub die Schanklizenz entzogen wurde, weshalb es kostenlos Guinness und Bier gibt. Von diesem Angebot machte Cihan rege und ausgiebig Gebrauch. Mir mangelte es dafür an der Prädilektion für Hefeweizenrzeugnisse (Eine tolle Gelegenheit das möglicherweise zurecht veraltete Wort Prädilektion wiederzubeleben).Das Hostel im Pub oder der Pub im Hostel?Mein Mitreisender frohen Mutes auf die Hostelpreislage blickendAm nächsten morgen standen wir – zu meiner eigenen Überraschung – um immerhin 10 Uhr morgens auf. Da ich umbedingt das Londoner Bürogebäude meines Brötchengebers Amazon von innen sehen wollte, fuhren wir mit der “tube” in die Innenstadt. Wenn man das erste mal nach längerer Zeit wieder in London ist und das erste Mal die Innenstadt bei Tageslicht sieht, ist man zwangsläufig für einen Moment erschlagen von der Ansehnlichkeit der Stadt. Alles ist sauberer, schöner, erlesener und aparter als in anderen Städten. Gerade, wenn man in Berlin lebt und einiges in Sachen Schludrigkeit und Versifftheit gewohnt ist, erschlägt einen London mit seiner doch so anderen Beschaffenheit. Die Kehrseite der Medaille sind natürlich die Wohnraumpreise und die enormen Lebenshaltungskosten.Sich verheißungsvoll auftürmende Fassaden heißen den Besucher sogleich willkommen.Das Büro von Amazon liegt zentral und ist ein hochmoderner Glasbau, der in einen klassische Umgebung eingebettet ist. Von innen blickt man so durch die großflächigen Glasfronten stets auf die alten Gebäudefassaden der Umgebung. Die Kantine auf dem Dach bietet neben (überteuertem) Essen auch einen tollen Überblick über London. Da die “publlc disclosure” Richtlinien das Posten von Fotos von Büroräumlichkeiten leider verbieten, kann ich nur Fotos des Panoramas anbieten. Eine Besonderheit, die man erwähnen kann, ohne sich gleich des Geheimnisverrats strafbar zu machen, sind die Aufzüge. Man wählt in jedem Stockwerk auf einem Touchscreen in welches Stockwerk man möchte und ein Computerprogramm weißt einem dann den passenden Aufzug zu (A/B/C/D/E/F). Schöne neue Welt! Ich nehme an, dass der Algorithmus da er nicht nur “möchte hoch” oder “möchte runter” kennt, die Fahrtzeiten minimieren kann, indem die Fahrgäste so gruppiert werden, dass allen möglichst wenig Zwischenhalte zugemutet werden. In der Praxis muss man allerdings dennoch auch mal länger auf den Aufzug warten. Dieses System nachzubauen und einen eigenen Algorithmus zu entwickeln wäre sicherlich ein lohnendes Wochenendprojekt. Auch nach diesem Besuch steht für mich außer Zweifel, dass Amazon zu den Arbeitgebern gehört, für bei denen man oder jedenfalls ich gerne beruflich Zeit verbringen möchte.Im Anschluss stand noch das Tate Modern auf dem Programm. Ein Besuch ist die Zeit auf jeden Fall wert. Auffällig ist, wie viele deutsche Künstler es in die Ausstellung geschafft haben. Der Großteil der Ausstellung ist mit klassischen Bildern auf Leinwand gefüllt, daneben gibt es auch einige Fotografien, Skulpturen und Videoinstallationen. Neben dem gallerieeigenen Café war eine Videowand zu bestaunen, die man als Besucher mit seinen eigenen Inhalten befüllen konnte. Nachdem Cihans aufwendigere Zeichnung es aus mysteriösen Gründen nicht auf die Leinwand schaffte, konnte ich zum Mindestens mein künstlerisches Potenzial entfalten und das Werk prominent positionieren!Diese Bleistiftzeichnung eines Fantasiearchitekten kann einen in ihren Bann ziehen.Funfact: Das Tate Modern ist in einem ehemaligen Industriegebäude untergebracht.Nun, was soll man dazu noch sagen? Meine Werke sind übereinander angeordnet. Wer findet sie?Der anstehende iPhone 6 Launch bescherte uns noch diesen Anblick von zeltenden Apple-Jüngern vor dem Apple-Store Covent Garden. Das ist rational nur schwerlich zu erklären&hellip;Später ging es noch durch die Londoner Innenstadt, natürlich auch zum obligatorischen Picadilly Square. Die titanische Leuchtreklametafel hinterließ einen zwiespältigen Eindruck. Einerseits ist es ein tolles Lichtspektakel, das die Nacht mit ihrem fahlen Licht erhellt und interessante Muster auf die Hausfassaden wirft, andererseits ist es auch schlechterdings hässlich, da sich hier Firmen Aufmerksamkeit kaufen, um ihre Marken in die Köpfe der Passanten zu brennen. Das passt nicht wirklich zu dem altehrwürdigen Stadtkern Londons. Ich würde die monströse LED-Anzeige wohl abmontieren lassen, aber mich fragt zum Glück niemand. Der Rest der Stadt ist ansonsten schließlich ja auch frei von jeglicher Anzeigenwerbung und besticht in erster Linie durch ihre hübschen und gepflegten Fassaden. Grade Nachts wirkt es fast surreal, wenn man durch diese Disney-World-Landschaft wandelt. Aber genug Laien-Pseudoarchitekturkritik für heute!",

        "content": "Problem:Der Moneycorp Geldautomat am Stansted Airport. Der Automat wirbt mit der Aufschrift &ldquo;Free cash withdrawal&rdquo;. Hasenfuß dabei: man muss mehrere Bildschirme, die einen mit Gebühren versehene Abrechnungsbildschirme präsentieren ablehnen. Der Auswahlbildschirm ist dabei so voll von Text, dass einem der wesentliche Preisaufschlag entgeht.  Konkret hieß das für mich: Ich möchte 150 Pfund ausgezahlt bekommen und mir werden 207 Euro von meinem Konto abgebucht. Der Wert der 150 Pfund entspricht jedoch nur 190 Euro. Die Differenz von 17 Euro geht also an den Automatenaufsteller.Lösungsvorschlag: Verpflichtung: Die letztlich eingezogene Summe mit Heimatwährungskurs muss der am Automaten ausgezahlten Summe im Heimatwährungskurs gegenübergestellt werden (Bsp.: Berechnet: 100€, Ausgezahlt: 90€). Und das europaweit (noch besser weltweit) einheitlich mit Farben unterlegt (z.B. grün/rot), damit Tricksereien mit Ausnutzung der Wahrnehmungsschwächen und der Orientierungslosigkeit von Menschen und Reisenden im besonderen unterbunden werden. Jemand der in ein anderes Land reist, womöglich ein wenig naiv ist und der Geld in einer anderen Währung benötigt ist das Ziel der Moneycorp und artverwandter Institutionen. Hier entsteht ein Bedürfnis. Natürlicherweise kommen nun Firmen ins Spiel, welche dieses Bedürfnis zu befriedigen suchen, um damit einen Gewinn zu erwirtschaften. Schön und gut, so funktioniert der Kapitalismus. Ekelhaft wird es, wenn Geschäftsmodelle m.E. haarscharf am Betrug vorbeischrammen indem sie menschliche Schwächen gezielt ausnutzen, um sich zu bereichern und individuell wie gesellschaftlich keinerlei Mehrwert schaffen.Perfide ist dabei erst recht, dass der Flughafen anscheinend der Moneycorp ein exklusives Vorrecht für das Aufstellen von Geldautomaten eingeräumt hat. Hier könnte man also durchaus von Kollusion sprechen!Die Moneycorp hat faktisch 17€ aus Luft gewonnen, verdient an meiner und anderer Dummheit und Ignoranz. Solche Geschäftsmodelle sind schäbigst und ihnen sollte durch den Gesetzgeber ein Riegel vorgeschoben werden. Es ist schlechterdings simpel unlauter, sittenwidrig und skrupellos. Ich finde es unhaltbar, wenn Menschen sich an Dummheit anderer bereichern und dabei Menschen Geld entziehen ohne eine Gegenleistung zu erbringen. Geld verdienen durch nichts anderes als schiere Perfidie. Ein Fall für den Verbraucherschutz sollte man meinen. Weiter noch ist dieser Umstand ein Argument, welches den Nutzen des einheitlichen Eurowährungsraums belegt, den die Briten so verschmähen.",

        "content": "Heute bin ich durch Zufall (eigentlich habe ich nach Dokumentationen zu Responsive Webdesign gesucht) auf ein, nun ja, ein wenig dekadent anmutendes Geschäftsmodell gestoßen: Zirtual. Dieses zugegeben innovative Konzept ist zwar nicht vollkommen neu, aber doch in seiner dem 21. Jahrhundert angepassten Form etwas so sicher zuvor nicht existentes Produkt. Die Zielgruppe ist auch außergewöhnlich. Das Produkt bzw. die Dienstleistung richtet sich an erfolgreiche Entrepreneure oder Angestellte von erfolgreichen Unternehmen in gehobenen Positionen. Eine kleine Zielgruppe möchte man meinen, doch nicht im Silicon Valley, wie die Testimonials der Website suggerieren. Dort sind so viele erfolgreiche Menschen, deren Work-Life-Balance von der vielen Arbeit ungleichgewichtig zu werden droht, dass sie sich einen “zirtual assistant” leisten wollen und das auch können. Nun, worum handelt es sich bei “Zirtual”? Zirtual stellt eine Dienstleistung zur Verfügung, die einfach, wie unschlagbar attraktiv ist: Zeit! Ein Zirtual-Kunde bekommt einen persönlichen Assistenten an seine Seite gestellt, der lästige Aufgaben, wie Powerpoints erstellen, Reservierungen im Restaurant vornehmen oder das lästige Email-Beantworten übernimmt. Das Konzept ist, dass Zirtual seine Assistenten von Zuhause aus arbeiten lässt und diese einem Klienten zuordnen. Das macht das ganze billiger als einen Butler. Ein Assistent betreut mehrere Klienten und diese bezahlen je nach Anforderung unterschiedliche Monatsbeiträge. Los geht es ab 199 Dollar für 8h Assistenz.Zirtual ist zugespitzt betrachtet der Butler für die Massen. Früher war es lediglich unverschämt reichen Menschen vorbehalten, sich einen persönlichen Assistenten leisten zu können, doch das ändert sich mit dem Internet und mit Zirtual. Ich kann es mir beim besten Willen nicht vorstellen, dass dieses Geschäftsmodell nicht auch von schwarzen Schafen so betrieben wird, dass der Assistent am Ende in einem Dritte-Welt-Land sitzt und für einen Hungerlohn der westlichen Mittelklasse assistiert. Zudem zeigt Zirtual auch, dass die Welt in der wir leben, ganz offensichtlich eine hochkomplexe Welt ist. Zu komplex für manche, so komplex, dass man eine Assistenz für seine Alltagsaufgaben benötigt oder doch zum Mindestens haben will.Die Welt wird, wie gesagt, anscheinend mit ihrer fortschreitenden Entwicklung immer komplexer, es ist zu bezweifeln, dass in der Steinzeit ein Geschäftsmodell wie Zirtual es hat, marktreif (geschweige denn realisierbar) gewesen wäre. Es bleibt abzuwarten, ob die Welt eines Tages so komplex ist, dass sie für den Menschen wieder einfacher wird. Ganz wie bei Computern. Zwischen den rudimentären Terminal-Computern und einem iPad heute, besteht ein himmelweiter Unterschied, was ihre Komplexität betrifft. Aber das Paradox des antiproportionalen Zusammenhangs von Systemkomplexität und Benutzerfreundlichkeit ist in diesem Beispiel eindeutig ersichtlich. Das iPad hat viel komplexere Software und viel komplexere, miniaturisierte Hardware. Aber die Einfachheit der Bedienung ist auch unglaublich gestiegen. Ein iPad kann von einem Analphabeten bedient werden. Ein Terminal-Computer kann hingegen nur von einer eher kleineren Gruppe benutz werden, die sich vorher mit den komplexen Regeln des Systems vertraut macht. Aber ich schweife ab&hellip;Einen Hausbutler, wie diesen, gibt es vorerst wohl auch erst einmal nur für den amerikanischen Präsidenten.",

        "content": "Die Erwartungen waren nicht hoch, als der Autor dieser Zeilen das Kino betrat um Transformers 3 in IMAX-3D anzuschauen (Weil ich mich selbst in der dritten Person nenne, ist dieser Text zwangsläufig journalistisch-objektiv, wenn man den großen Zeitungen Glauben schenken darf). Die Quintessenz ist, dass dieser Film wie ein Pornofilm daherkommt: Eine sehr holprige und inkonsistente Story mit vielen, geilen Bildern, die mit der Zeit mit der Reiz-Hemmschwelle zu kämpfen haben.Eines gleich vorweg: Die Bilder, die der Film an die (enorm große 3D-) Leinwand malt, sind durchaus beeindruckend und streckenweise auch ästhetisch. Auch wenn die Bildsprache sich insgesamt nicht besonders hervortut, so hat sie doch ihre lichten Momente, etwa, wenn die Kamera dem Zuschauer das idyllische Haus des Hauptprotagonisten in Texas präsentiert.Apropos Protagonisten: Die Drehbuchschreiber haben sich doch tatsächlich an dem Husarenstück probiert, ein Alien-Epos mit einem Teenagertrashfilm zu kombinieren. Konkret sieht das dann etwa so aus, dass der Hauptprotagonist, umgeben von sich wechselseitig mit Hieben bedenkenden Alienriesenrobotern, beklagt, dass der Freund der Tochter doch bitte die Finger von selbiger zu nehmen hat. Auch fällt hier auf, dass die Rolle der Tochter sich leider wieder einmal mehr auf ängstlich gucken, kreischen und um ihre Männer (Vater &amp; Freund) besorgt sein, reduziert ist. Da hilft es wenig, dass zum Mindestens die chinesische Bing Bing Li ein wenig austeilen darf.Überhaupt ist es bemerkenswert, wie sich die asiatische Teilfinanzierung in dem Film niederschlägt. Nicht nur darf die in China unfassbar populäre Bing Bing Li in einem krude konstruierten Zusammenhang die chinesische Businessfrau spielen; nein, der ganze Film wird zum Ende hin nach China verlegt. Das Kalkül scheint hier zu sein: Das lockt auch die chinesischen Zuschauermassen ins Publikum. Spätestens wenn der menschliche Bösewicht am Ende in einem Hong-Konger Hochhaus erklärt, dass er sein Handeln aus Liebe zu Amerika und um amerikanische Soldaten zu beschützen so wählt, wie er es wählt, wird es zwangsläufig selbstentlarvend absurd. Dieser Part ist so hirnverbrannt, dass einem die Situation der Macher des Films ähnlich der von Amerika und China erscheint. Wenn es um Geld geht, sind sich beide Seiten schnell einig, ansonsten wird aber erst einmal der Egotrip gefahren. Am Ende leidet der Rest darunter, im wahren Leben die Bevölkerung und beim Film die Zuschauer.",

        "content": "Nun, erst einmal, so möchte man meinen, gibt es doch nichts berichtenswertes darüber, dass der ehemalige Entwicklungsminister, der sein eigenes Ministerium abschaffen wollte - wir erinnern uns - nach seinem Ausscheiden aus dem Amt eine Anschlussverwendung gefunden hat. Dass Niebel jetzt als Lobbyist für einen Industriekonzern arbeitet ist auch nichts überraschendes. Wenngleich ein Wechsel von der Politik in die Wirtschaft kritisch zu betrachten ist, wie beim Fall Pofalla etwa. Der Verdacht der Verwischung von privaten Interessen mit den öffentlichen während der Amtszeit und die hernach folgende Belohnung durch den begünstigten Industriebetrieb oder -zweig steht stets im Raum. Allein die Tatsache, dass ein solcher Verdacht erweckt werden könnte, sollte Anlass genug sein, von solchen Praktiken Abstand zu nehmen. Leider haben zu wenig Ex-Berufspolitiker den Anstand und die Geradlinigkeit, um den Versuchungen zu widerstehen. Zumindest nicht gleich ein halbes Jahr später in genau dem Bereich anzufangen, den man vorher noch reguliert hat oder den man zu regulieren vorgab, sollte man doch schaffen können.Aber was dem Fass den Boden ausschlägt, ist der Umstand, dass Dirk Niebel nun de facto Cheflobbyist für den Rüstungskonzern Rheinmetall wird. Meines Erachtens nach, ist es eine Ungeheuerlichkeit und es mutet bizarr an, dass der Ex-Entwicklungsminister sich nun offensichtlich als Vehikel nutzen lässt, um den Funktionären, denen er früher deutsche Entwicklungsprogramme schmackhaft machte, als Nachgang nur zur Sicherheit und Freude Rheinmetalls gleich ein Panzerbataillon feilzubieten. Auch wenn Niebel auf mich schon immer einen wenig guten Eindruck gemacht hat, so hat er sich mit der Annahme dieses Jobs in meinen Augen Farbe bekannt; und zwar als ein Opportunist, der im Zweifelsfall dem großen Geld folgt, statt einem inneren moralischen Kompass. Ich mache Politik, um etwas zu Gestalten. Ich mache Politik, um etwas zu verändern. Ich mache Politik für die Menschen in diesem Land. Niebels Handeln lässt diese ohnehin tendenziell abgeschmackten Phrasen wie Hohn und Spott erscheinen. Er möchte etwas verändern? Er möchte einem Waffenproduzenten beim Vertrieb seiner Tötungsmaschinen helfen? Das einzige was sich dadurch signifikant positiv verändert, ist sein eigener Kontostand, aber auch nicht viel mehr. Die Botschaft aber ist eine verheerende: Politiker sind sich am Ende des Tages doch selbst am nächsten, sogar für das moralisch höchst zweifelhafte Stellenangebot einer Waffenschmiede ist Niebel, immerhin ein ehemaliger Bundesminister, sich nicht zu Schade. Es ist beim besten Willen nicht vorstellbar, wie man diesem Sachverhalt etwas positives abgewinnen kann. “Papa hilft jetzt Rheinmetall mehr Panzer zu verkaufen, damit die Welt sicherer wird und mehr Arbeitsplätze entstehen!” Wie auch immer sich Niebel seine Rechtfertigung zurechtgebastelt hat, so dürfte sie die Rechtfertigung eines Zynikers sein, der sich der Versuchung des Geldes nicht länger hat entziehen wollen. Öffentlich äußert er sich dazu nicht, was Bände spricht.Dieser Fall im doppelten Wortsinne zeigt nicht etwa alleinig, dass Dirk Niebel über die beachtliche Fähigkeit verfügt, das Rückgrat einer Salatschnecke eindrucksvoll erscheinen lassen, sondern vielmehr, dass es eben kein Zufall ist, dass Deutschland dritt-größter Waffenexporteur auf diesem Planeten ist. Wenn Waffenproduzenten die Chuzpe haben, sich ehemalige Kabinettsmitglieder einzukaufen und damit davonkommen, so entsteht der Eindruck, beim Kabinettstisch handele es sich um ein Supermarktregal, in dem sich die Großindustrie frohen Mutes bedient. Es ist wahrlich eine verquere Angelegenheit im Amt Frieden und Abrüstung zu predigen und nachher bei einem der größten Waffenproduzenten anzuheuern und seine Kontakte und sein Insider-Wissen willfährig anzubieten. Warum lässt sich Dirk Niebel nicht einfach als politischer Berater bei einem x-beliebigen, anderen Konzern anstellen? Warum sucht er sich nicht einfach ein neues politisches Betätigungsfeld, wie sein Parteifreund Westerwelle mit seiner Stiftung? Die Antwort ist offensichtlich und sie ist keine schöne: Weil man nirgendwo sonst so viel Geld verdienen kann. Dirk Niebel hat sich versteigern lassen und der höchstbietende Auktionär war halt ein Waffenkonzern, der muss nun mal auch etwas mehr bieten, um die moralisch anrüchige Aura zu kompensieren. Ich empfinde fast ein gewisses Mitleid mit Niebel, den sein Drang zum Geld verdienen trotz auskömmlicher Ruhebezüge zu so fragwürdigen Entscheidungen zwingt. Auch FDP-Urgestein Gerhard Baum kritisiert Niebel scharf: Etwa hier nachzulesen. Der FDP hilft Niebels Handeln auch eher nicht, doch das schert Niebel anscheinend so wenig, wie sein Handeln der FDP hilft.",

        "content": "Die zu Grunde liegende Studie ist veröffentlicht und ist hier zugänglich.Kurz gefasst, haben Forscher bei englischsprachigen Facebook-Nutzern folgendes gemacht: Sie haben bei Testgruppen den Facebook-Newsfeed manipuliert. Und das folgendermaßen: Bei einer Gruppe wurden positive Posts herausgefiltert und bei den anderen negative. Die emotionale Gewichtung entnahm man einem speziellen Wortverzeichnis. Anschließend wurde untersucht, wie sich die Manipulierung des Newsfeeds auf die Posts der Nutzer auswirkte. Dazu gab es dann auch noch jeweilige Kontrollgruppen. Das Ergebnis war, dass sich ein Zusammenhang feststellen ließ. Kamen in dem manipulierten Newsfeed vermehrt positive Posts vor, so posteten die Nutzer auch vermehrt positiv. Selbiges gilt mit Blick auf die negative Filterung. Und insgesamt stellte man fest, dass die durch die Filterung mit emotionaleren Posts angereicherten Newsfeeds auch mehr Posts der Nutzer generiert. Diese Beeinflussung wurde ohne das Wissen der Nutzer vorgenommen, somit wurden sie unbewusst beeinflusst. Allein der Umstand, dass ein solches Experiment von den Facebook-AGBs anscheinend abgedeckt wird, ist gruselig genug. Weiter zeigt dieses Experiment aber auch, dass man den Einfluss von Algorithmen auf die Gesellschaft nicht unterschätzen darf. Wenn Facebook seinen Newsfeed-Algorithmus ändert, ist das nicht der Untergang des Abendlandes, aber dieser noch harmlose Eingriff lässt auch erahnen, was mit Eingriffen in Direktkommunikation, Suchergebnisse etc. alles möglich wäre.Dieses Experiment massiven Ausmaßes war so groß, dass selbst die Facebook-Infrastruktur zeitweise zusammenbrach und das ganze in einen zeitweisen Facebook-Ausfall resultierte. Natürlich kann man dem Experiment auch etwas positives abgewinnen, so verweisen die Autoren selbst darauf, dass es einen belegten Zusammenhang zwischen Emotionen und Gesundheit gibt. Es ist wie beim Lügendetektor; diesen pauschal als amoralisches Teufelswerk abzutun, wäre selbstgerecht gegenüber den unschuldig im Gefängnis eine Strafe verbüßenden Justizirrtums-Opfern. So wäre es auch denkbar, dass angesichts der Größe Facebooks mit solchen Änderungen am Algorithmus tatsächlich Leben oder jedenfalls Lebenszeit gerettet werden könnte. Es klingt absurd, ist aber dennoch weniger abwegig, als man vermuten mag. Der Einfluss ist jedoch, wie man der Grafik entnehmen kann, kein gewaltiger.Wenn man die Skala beachtet stellt man fest: Die maximale Abweichung der Prozentwerte ist &ldquo;bloß&rdquo; 0,02% (oben rechts)Dennoch sollte es einen aufhorchen lassen. Das öffentlich oft als Paradebeispiel zitierte unschmeichelhafte Partybild ist zwar eingängig und leicht verständlich, die implizite Einflussnahme durch intransparente Algorithmen ist hingegen eine eher abstrakte und öffentlich nicht ausreichend präsente Thematik, die meines Erachtens mehr Aufmerksamkeit verdient. So gibt es beispielsweise in der Piratenpartei Forderungen nach gesetzlichen Regulierungen für Algorithmen, die bestimmte Szenarions schlichtweg verbietet.",

        "content": "Alles nahm, wenn man denn so will, 1886 seinen Anfang, als sich in Teilen Nordamerikas der zuvor von der Arbeitbewegung ausgerufene Generalstreik zur Durchsetzung des 8-Stunden-Tags vollzog. In Chicago trug es sich zu, dass damals schon, wie auch heute bisweilen, eine Massenversammlung außer Kontrolle geriet. Nur nicht am 1. Mai, sondern am 3. Mai nach einem mehrtägigen Streik. Am nächsten Tag eskalierte eine weitere Kundgebung und in der Folge kam es zu Toten aufseiten der Polizei und der Demonstranten. Die Justiz klagte die acht Organisatoren der Kundgebung an, unter anderem den Chefredakteur und Herausgeber des &ldquo;Arbeiter-Magazins&rdquo;  August Spies. Vier von ihnen, auch Spies, wurden zum Tod durch den Strick verurteilt. Vor seinem Tod am Galgen rief Spies &ldquo;The day will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle today.&rdquo; Und in gewisser Weise sollte er Recht behalten, Texas ausgenommen. Sein Urteil und das der weiteren Mitangeklagten wurde schließlich auch 1893 vom Gouverneur von Illinois annuliert. Zu ihrer Gedenken wurde 1889, im Rahmen der Neugründung der Internationalen nach Marx'schem Vorbild, der 1. Mai zum &ldquo;Kampftag der Arbeiterbewegung&rdquo; erklärt und als solcher zum ersten Mal 1890 begangen (Wikipedia berichtete).In Deutschland wurde unter den Nazis der 1. Mai schließlich umfunktioniert, zum &ldquo;Feiertag der nationalen Arbeit&rdquo; und dadurch auch ein gesetzlicher Feiertag, was die Nazis nicht davon abhielt gleichzeitig auf drastische Weise und ohne Skrupel die Gewerkschaften zu zerschlagen.Nun ja, diese Entwicklungen angefangen bei Marx, Mehreren Toten im Chicago des späten 19. Jahrhunderts und gar unter den Nazis fortgeführt zeitigten also in Deutschland und ganz konkret für mich am 1. Mai 2014 den &ldquo;Ersten Mai in Kreuzberg&rdquo;. Auch hier hilft der Digitalzeitalmanach Wikipedia eine Kurzübersicht zu gewinnen:Der Erste Mai in Kreuzberg bezeichnet die durch linke und linksradikale Gruppen organisierten Straßenfeste und Demonstrationen am 1. Mai, dem Tag der Arbeit, in Berlin-Kreuzberg. Speziell bezieht sich der Begriff auf den 1. Mai 1987, als in Kreuzberg bis dahin ungekannte schwere Unruhen ausbrachen und sich die Berliner Polizei für mehrere Stunden vollständig aus [&hellip;] dem östlichen Teil Kreuzbergs zurückziehen musste. Seitdem führen Autonome und Antifa-Gruppen fast jedes Jahr eine oder mehrere sogenannte Revolutionäre 1.-Mai-Demonstrationen durch.-WikipediaIch beschloss also mir das ganze - gemeint ist die 18-Uhr-Demo in Kreuzberg - einmal genauer anzusehen. Insbesondere reizte mich das eigene mediengeprägte Bild dieser Kundgebung und in der Konsequenz die Berichterstattung der Medien, die meistens auf die Ausschreitungen reduziert wird, einmal einem Realitätsabgleich zu unterziehen. &ldquo;Ist es denn wirklich alles so schlimm?&rdquo; war also, die - zugegeben - etwas naive Fragestellung mit der ich an die Sache herantrat. Inhaltliche Punkte gehen, so ist mein Eindruck im Tumult und in den Ausschreitungen zumeist vollkommen unter. Irgendwelche linke bis linksradikale Forderungen sind die Oberbegriffe, unter die ich diese Veranstaltung in den letzten Jahren einordnete, wenn sie denn einmal in den Medien auftauchte. Leider bleibt hier der Inhalt, die Botschaft der Demo, - so ist mein Eindruck - hinter der Form zurück. Doch es gibt auch nicht immer übereinstimmende, wenngleich doch dezidiert-inhaltliche Forderungen der Demonstranten oder zum Mindestens der Organisatoren. So hieß es in einer Mail der Berliner Jusos zur 18-Uhr-Demo:[&hellip;]01. Mai 18 Uhr: UNSERE Zukunft statt IHRER Profite - Jugendblock auf der 18 Uhr DemoUnter diesem Titel wird es auf der diesjährigen Revolutionären 18 Uhr Demo einen Jugendblock geben. Gemeinsam mit Gewerkschafts- und Antifajugenden wollen wir hier die Situation der Auszubildenden thematisieren. Nicht nur die fehlenden Ausbildungs- und Studiumsplätze, auch die prekären Bedingungen nach dem Abschluss, durch schlechte/unbezahlte Praktika, Volontariate und Traineestellen, sowie keine Übernahme durch die Ausbildungsbetriebe berauben junger Menschen der Basis für eine gesicherte Zukunft. Gleichzeitig generiert sich die Bundeswehr an Schulen und auf Ausbildungsmessen als ein Ausbildungsbetrieb mit guten Zukunftschancen und trägt so zu einer Militarisierung der Gesellschaft bei. Für uns gilt: Ausbildungssituation verbesser! Bundeswehr raus aus Schulen!Bitte bringt keine Jusofahnen mit, seid einfach mit uns zusammen präsent und unterstützt den Jugebdblock. In den letzten Jahren wurde die Demo oft vor dem Erreichen des eigentlichen Ziels aufgelöst. Bitte stellt euch darauf ein, dass das auch dieses Jahr passieren kann. Der Jugendblock wird als letzter Block in der Demo laufen. Sollte sich daher abzeichnen, dass es zu Auseinandersetzungen kommt, oder die Demo aufgelöst wird, besteht frühzeitig die Möglichkeit problemlos zu gehen.Den gesamten Aufruf findet ihr hier: http://erstermai.nostate.net/wordpress/?p=559Wir treffen uns um 18 Uhr am Lausitzer Platze Ecke Skalitzer Straße (vor dem Hühnerhaus 36).Ansprechpartnerinnen für euch sind Anna (0151 [&hellip;]) und Lea (0151 [&hellip;])Auf einen kämpferischen 1. Mai!Sozialistische Grüße,der Landesvorstand der Jusos BerlinFrüh genug mache ich mich also am Abend des ersten Mais mit einigen Mitstreitern auf zum U-Bahnhof &ldquo;Görlitzer Bahnhof&rdquo;, wo der Demonstrationszug seinen Anfang nimmt. Auf dem Hinweg sind in umittelbarer Nähe zum Demozug bereits die überfüllten S- und U-Bahn-Stationen bemerkbar. Noch bemerkenswerter ist die Ansage, die wir an der &ldquo;U Warschauer Straße&rdquo; zu hören bekommen: &ldquo;Junger Mann, bitte stellen sie das urinieren auf dem Bahnsteig ein!&rdquo;. Anscheinend blicken ein paar BVG-Mitarbeiter mit Argusaugen auf die Monitore mit den Bildern der Überwachungskamera und versuchen - Oh Wunder! - doch tatsächlich die BVG-Regeln durchzusetzen. Sogar Raucher auf den Bahnsteigen werden durch wirsche Lautsprecherdurchsagen angeherrscht, dies doch zu unterlassen. Warum nicht öfter so? Da hat der 1. Mai also schon mal einen positiven Effekt. Dies passiert an normalen Tagen sonst nicht bis nie, da kann man schon mal ewig und drei Tage warten, bis ein BVG-Beamter auf die Idee kommt, dass es ja ein Rauchverbot gibt.Angekommen bietet sich dem Betrachter erst einmal ein konfuses Wimmelbild aus tausenden Menschen in verschiedensten Kleidungsstilen, Zuständen und Stimmungen. In der Luft liegt eine kirmesartige, ausgelassene, positive Atmosphäre. Auch wenn ich mehr Menschen erwartet hatte: Es ist verdammt voll. Der Zug ist bereits im Gange. Noch auffälliger als das bengalische Feuer, das einige Demonstranten entzünden sind nur die unzähligen Polizeitransporter, die bereitstehen, um sich dem Ende der Demo anzuschließen. Weil der Zug schon deutlich weiter ist, gehen wir etwas schneller, um zum Anfang der Demo zu gelangen. Auf dem Weg dorthin passieren wir verschiedene Blöcke im Demonstrationszug. Manche beschränken sich aufs &ldquo;An-ti! An-ti! An-tikapita-lis-ta!&rdquo; skandieren, andere beschallen ihre Umgebung mit linksalternativem Rap und wieder andere üben fundierte politische Kritik aus Lautsprecherwagen. Der Demonstrationszug endet planmäßig vor der SPD-Parteizentrale, was eine Sprecherin aufgreift, um etwa die Hartz-IV-Gesetze anzuprangern und der SPD Raubbau am Sozialstaat vorzuwerfen.Auffällig sind auch die schwarzen Blöcke, nein hierbei handelt es sich nicht um eine rassistische Auslassung meinerseits, sondern um Gruppierungen von komplett in schwarz gekleideten Demonstranten. Auch sonst fallen mir Menschen mit schwarzen Cargo-Pants und schwarzen Pullis und Kapuzenanoraks auf. Das sind die Menschen, die in den Medien zurecht (?) mit dem Stigma Autonome versehen werden. Unwillkürlich rücken sie die Szenerie in ein düstereres Licht, ganz als ob kommende Ausschreitungen ihre lange Schatten vorauswerfen.Insgesamt herrscht aber - wie gesagt geschrieben - eher Jahrmarktsstimmung, in Cafés und Bars wird laut Musik gespielt, Menschen tanzen angeheitert auf Tischen, trinken, sind betrunken, sind volltrunken und urinieren an Hausfassaden. Kurz es herrscht keine angespannte oder gar womöglich aggressive Atmosphäre. Dieser Eindruck wird von den friedlichen Menschen und Demonstranten aus allen Altersgruppen und auch von Eltern, die mit ihren Kindern unterwegs sind, bekräftigt. Wie nachzulesen ist, gehört dies zum Sicherheitskonzept der Polizei: Alternative Veranstaltungen, wie das sogenannte MyFest! werden gefördert, um die Umgebung mit friedlichen Menschen zu besetzen und Aggressionen dadurch im Keim zu ersticken. Auch sonst fährt die Polizei teilweise recht kluge Strategien. So setzt sie etwa das Flaschenverbot im Görlitzer Park mit Köpfchen durch: Polizisten halten Plastikbecher bereit, in die man den Inhalt seiner Flasche umfüllen kann. Aber ich schweife wieder ab! In der Mitte des Demonstrationszuges entdeckt mein Mitbewohner Hans Christian Ströbele, der - sein Fahrrad schiebend - die Demonstration begleitet. Als linkes Urgestein der Grünen und als direktgewählter Abgeordneter für Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg muss er sich natürlich hier blicken lassen. Ihn sollten wir später noch einmal treffen. Ich bin mir nicht ganz sicher in wie weit er seine Aufgabe auch als Schutzfunktion bei unverhältnismässiger Polizeigewalt sieht. Als Abgeordneter hat er gegenüber der Polizei eine gewisse Autorität und weitreichende Auskunftsrechte. Dass wir ihn später wiedersahen, als er direkt am U-Bahnhof Hallesches Tor die zu eskalieren drohende, sehr angespannte Situation besah und dort hinging, wo es weh tat, gibt dieser Theorie recht. Der Polizeieinsatz selbst wurde vom Berliner Senat, genauer dem Innensenator verantwortlich organisiert. Auch von hinten sollte Ströbele im nachfolgenden Bild zu erkennen sein:Das Vorgehen der Polizei war äußerst bemerkenswert. Das Sicherheitskonzept der Polizei ließ die Befürchtung einer erwarteten Straßenschlacht aufkommen. Es konnte der Eindruck entstehen, man befände sich, eingekesselt von Polizei, in einer Sperrzone. Auf den Dächern von hohen Gebäuden waren Späher mit Ferngläsern zu gewahren, die den Demonstrationszug von oben herab überwachten beobachteten. Es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass diese bewaffnet waren. Jedenfalls waren keine Sniper, wie beim Besuch Obamas postiert. Der öfters zu hörende Helikopter leistete wahrscheinlich sein übriges zur Überwachung der Demonstration.Der Demonstrationszug wurde am Ende durch die knapp 10 Mannschaftswagen der Polizeihundertschaften und die vorrausfahrenden Polizeimannschaftswagen und Polizeifahrzeuge in der die Einsatzkoordination stattfand eingekesselt. Zusätzlich stand an jeder Abzweigung von der Demoroute entweder eine Barrikade aus Mannschaftswagen oder Hundertschaften der Polizei. Zeitweise wurde die Demo auch von Polizisten flankiert. Die Diskrepanz zwischen friedlicher Stimmung und diesem Aufgebot der Staatsmacht war zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch eher unverständlich.Als wir, um an der zähfließenden Masse schneller vorbeizukommen, in eine Parallelstraße abbiegen, staunen wir nicht schlecht: Wir sehen uns einer Legion von Polizisten in Vollschutzmontur gegenüber. Nie zuvor habe ich ein derartiges Bild geboten bekommen. Polizisten von beachtlicher Statur und mit noch beachtlicherer Schutzkleidung. Alles Männer zwischen 20 und 30. Alle riesig. Alle &ldquo;biodeutsch&rdquo;. Alle mit Knopf im Ohr, Helm, Handschuhen und Pfefferspray ausgerüstet. Diese Unformität, diese Masse an ähnlichen Menschen, selektiert nach einem Kriterium: Fähigkeit zur Ausübung des staatlichen Gewaltmonopols zur Durchsetzung der Staatsmacht. Es hat etwas beängstigendes und beruhigendes und irgendwie beeindruckendes zugleich. Was unser aller Staat doch für Strukturen und Werkzeuge aufzubauen vermag, um die Wahrung von Recht und Ordnung zu gewährleisten. Das einmal so konkret zu sehen und damit konfrontiert zu werden ist doch etwas ganz anderes als irgendwelche Schemata mit Exekutive, Legislative etc. zu analysieren. Brichst du das Gesetz, brech ich dir die Beine - so könnte man es zugespitzt umschreiben.Aber ich schweife ab! Durch unseren Abstecher in die Seitenstraße konnten wir einen unverhofften Blick hinter die Kulissen der Polizeitaktik werfen. Weil die Anzahl der Einsatzkräfte - der üppigen Anzahl zum Trotz - wohl doch nicht reichte, um an jeder Kreuzung und Abbiegung Hunderschaften zu postieren, liefen die Polizisten, nach dem Passieren des Demonstrationszugs, zur nächsten Kreuzung, um diese zu blockieren. In ihren Uniformen, ihren Panzern haben verlieren die Polizisten nach Außen ein Stück ihrer Menschlichkeit. Da manche keine Helme haben, ist zumindest noch das Gesicht zu erkennen. Dennoch schweben einem die Bilder von Polizeigewalt bei Demonstration im Kopf herum. In nähe der Polizisten verhält man sich anders. Es fühlt sich unfrei an. Man steht unter Beobachtung. Diese mittelbare, sehr subtile Beschneidung der Demonstrationsfreiheit mag ihre Berechtigung haben, dennoch darf man diesen Effekt nicht ausser Acht lassen.Am Anfang des Demozugs angekommen, bleiben wir stehen und beobachten den vorbeiziehenden Zug in seiner ganzen Länge. Berichtenswert ist der Umstand, dass ein flinker Mittzwanziger in schwarzer Kleidung - natürlich - sich bemüßigt fühlte jegliches am Straßenrand angebrachte Wahlplakat zu entfernen. &ldquo;Das finde ich richtig cool!&rdquo; ist die Bewertung der Sprecherin in einem der Demowagen. Eine besondere Spezies von mit dieser Demo verbunden Menschen fällt auch noch auf, der sogenannte Aufstandsjournalist. Er tut sich durch seine Montur bestehend aus Helm mit GoPro-Camera, festes Schuhwerk, wasserwerferfester Kleidung und Schutzbrille in Griffweite hervor. So sehen wir etwa einen Repräsentanten dieser Gattung, der auf seinem Schutzhelm den Schriftzug RIOTPRESS trägt. Angesprochen auf seine Tätigkeit, erklärt Mr. Riotpress, dass er einen Youtube-Kanal unter selbigem Namen betreibt. Einer muss das alles ja schließlich dokumentieren. Nicht das adrenalinärmste Hobby, genau das richtige für jeden &ldquo;thrillseeker&rdquo;, dem nur dabei sein nicht genug ist.Nun nehme ich auch zum ersten Mal das teilweise vorhandene und sich an Polizisten entladende Gewaltpotenzial wahr. Eine der die Demo flankierenden Hundertschaften zieht an mir vorbei und es sticht einem sofort ins Auge, dass manchen Polizisten ein &ldquo;Autonomer&rdquo; folgt (Ohne Alle die in diese Kategorie gezählt werden, stigmatisieren zu wollen. Es sind höchstens eine Hand voll. In Ermangelung eines anderen Labels, nenne ich sie aufgrund ihrer Kleidung Autonome, was der Sache nicht gerecht wird, aber der Einfachheit halber so gehandhabt wird.). Diese Autonome folgen, dicht an ihnen gedrängt, den Polizisten und beschimpfen sie auf schäbigste Art und Weise. In ihren Worten und Äußerungen liegen in Inhalt und Tonalität so viel Hass und Menschenverachtung, dass ich erstaunt bin, dass die Polizisten nach außen ruhig bleiben und nicht tätlich aktiv werden. Nein, mehr noch, die Polizisten antworten nicht einmal auf Schmähungen, wie: &ldquo;Wir wollen euch nicht!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Haut ab! Haut ab! Haut ab!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ihr seid hier unerwünscht!&rdquo;. Später traf wir noch auf einen solchen auf Krawall aus seienden Menschen, der vor einem Polizisten, der zwei Köpfe größer war, stand und ihn aufs übelste mit herabsetztenden Äusserungen bedachte: &ldquo;Wer hat euch denn eigentlich eingeladen? Was macht ihr hier? Ich verdiene 80.000 im Jahr. Ich bin selbstständig, ich bezahl dich doch!&rdquo;. Der Polizist ließ sich auf dieses nur zu verlierende Spiel ein und antwortete auch noch zähneknirschend. Den Agressor, der den Polizist hier so anging, und sein Gehalt noch auf prahlerische Weise ins Spiel brachte, genauer zu charakterisieren fällt schwer. Es ist aber leichter, als bei den anderen, da wir den Mann nach der Demo zufällig trafen und auf seine ehrenrührige Worte ansprachen. Wie sich herausstellte, war er anscheinend Kälteanlagenbaumeister und beschäftigte mehrere Angestellte. Dennoch machte er einen schizophrenen Eindruck. Auf der einen Seite lenkte er ein, dass seinen verbalen Attacken gegen den Polizisten zu weit gingen, aber auf der anderen Seite schrie er - kurz nachdem er dies zugestand - wieder vorbeilaufende Polizisten an. Dann wurde es völlig abstrus, als er sich in Hasstiraden auf die Polizei erging, wobei offenbar eine entscheidende Rolle spielte, dass er seinen Führerschein abgeben musste. Hier schien jemand den 1. Mai als Ventil für seine im voranggeganen Jahr angehäufte privaten Frustrationen zu nutzen. Sein Vorgehen rechtfertigte er vor uns und sich selbst anscheinend damit, dass die Polizisten niemand eingeladen habe, dass er sie bezahle und dass sie ihm schonmal Unannehmlichkeiten bereitet hatten. Nachdem er sich empfahl, nicht ohne meinen Mitbewohner aufgrund seiner konservativen Positionen als Faschisten zu bezeichnen, atmeten wir sichtlich auf. Es war einer der unangenehmeren Menschen, denen ich in meinem Leben begegnet bin, auch wenn sich sein Hass nicht gegen mich richtete, war er doch so stumpfsinnig und unzivilisiert, dass ich mich nur wundern konnte, wie so ein Mensch einen Betrieb zu führen vermag. Vielleicht ja grade deswegen. Nach dem 1. Mai ist er womöglich brav wie ein Lamm und freut sich als Antikapitalist über seine 80.000 Euro im Jahr.Die Situation war bis jetzt insgesamt ziemlich ruhig geblieben. Doch nach dem ofiziellen Ende der Demo vor der SPD-Parteizentrale nahe der U-Bahnstation Hallesches Tor kam es doch zu einer Fast-Eskalation, so muss man es nennen. Die Situation war die folgende. Anscheinend hatte sich eine Reihe Autonomer am U-Bahnsteig versammelt und aus irgendeinem Grund hielt die Polizei es für opportun diesen zu stürmen. In Medienberichten wurde eine Überfüllung des U-Bahnsteiges nach einer Notbremsung der U-Bahn als Grund genannt. Es rannte also eine Hundertschaft beherzt auf den Bahnsteig und hielt sich dort auf. Autonome, die dies nicht guthießen schrien in einem markerschütterndem Ton und einer für mich bis dahin ubbekannten Agression Parolen, wie: &ldquo;Haut ab! Haut ab!&rdquo; oder auch &ldquo;Ganz Berlin hasst, hasst, hasst die Polizei!&rdquo;. Darüber hinaus kam es auch zu Rangeleien mit Polizisten. Einige wurden verhaftet. Wir konnten all dies vom gegenüberliegenden Bahnsteig beobachten. Das Getöse war ohrenbetäubend. Viele Menschen in der U-Bahn hatten sichtlich Angst, weil sie sich mit dem Polizeihass so gar nicht identifizieren konnten, aber im Wagen eingeschlossen waren. In der Bahn sitzen die meisten regungslos und geben sich ihrem Schicksal hin. Eine junge Frau fasst sich an den Kopf und schüttelt - den Tränen nahe - fassungslos ihren Kopf. Andere öffnen die Türen der U-Bahn auf der Gleisseite, um zummindest etwas frische Luft zu erhaschen. Auch auf unserer Gleisseite kommt es zu Unruhe als drei Autonome BVG-Sicherheitsbeamte anpöbeln. Einem von ihnen schaut ein Luftgewehr aus dem Rucksack. Ebenfalls ist eine Zwille ersichtlich, die aus dessen Rucksack hervorlugt. Irgendwann wird es den BVG-Beamten zu viel und sie verständigen ein paar Polizisten. Diese lassen die drei Unruhestifter jedoch wieder laufen. Die BVG-Sicherheitsbeamten sind sichtlich mit der Situation überfordert. Auf der anderen Seite, so erzählen nacher Augenzeugen, nahm die Polizei jeden fest, der der Aufforderung den Bahnsteig zu verlassen nicht nachkam. Während Polizisten die Festgenommenen abführen, fragen andere Demonstranten nach den Namen und dem Geburtsdatum der Festgenommenen, um einen Anwalt für sie zu organisieren, der sie möglichst schnell wieder auf freien Fuß bringt.Alles in allem ist der 1. Mai (bzw. die 18-Uhr-Demo) eine leider an ihrer Entpolitisierung krankende Veranstaltung, die als weitergedachte Linie die von den für bessere Bedingungen protestierenden Arbeiter nicht mehr viel hat. Wobei es natürlich sein kann, das es sich ehedem im 19. Jahrhundert nicht viel anders zutrug. In Form einer solchen Masse differenzierte politische Forderungen zu äussern ist dann womöglich doch ein Ding der Unmöglichkeit. Teil davon waren sicherlich, die Leute, die Flyer verteilten zur Blockierung von Hausräumungen, die Demowagen, die konkrete Kritik äusserten und alle, die sich friedlich in einem Demoblock einordneten und damit Unterstützung für dessen Forderungen zeigten.Die mediale Berichterstattung im Nachgang war erwartbarerweise reduziert auf die Auseinandersetzungen, erwähnt wurde aber meist auch, dass es insgesamt doch friedlich zuging. So berichtete der RBB äusserst differenziert und lieferte ein nach meiner Sicht realistisches Bild der Lage, welches sich mit meinen Beobachtungen deckt.Die Süddeutsche erwähnte Kreuzberg immerhin in einem Absatz:Auch bei der Mai-Demonstration in Berlin kam es zu Ausschreitungen, schwere Gewaltausbrüche wie in früheren Jahren gab es jedoch nicht.19 000 Menschen zogen nach Angaben der Polizei mit Transparenten und lauten Sprechchören durch Kreuzberg - weit mehr als ursprünglich erwartet. Wiederholt griffen Demonstranten Einsatzkräfte an. Böller wurden gezündet, Steine, Flaschen und Farbbeutel flogen.Dennoch zeigte sich die Polizei weitgehend zufrieden, sie war mit einem Großaufgebot im Einsatz. Die &ldquo;Revolutionäre 1. Mai-Demonstration&rdquo; endete nach knapp zwei Stunden vor der abgesperrten Zentrale der Bundes-SPD.Danach kam es noch stundenlang zu Rangeleien in Kreuzberg. Polizisten setzten etwa am U-Bahnhof Hallesches Tor Reizgas ein. Wie ein Polizeisprecher sagte, wurden dort fünf Beamte verletzt.-Die SüddeutscheDie Autorin der Welt stichelt unter dem Titel &ldquo;In Kreuzberg brennen nur die Kohlen am Köfte-Grill&rdquo;:Das linksradikale Kreuzberg hat sich selbst besiegt. Am 1. Mai brennen dort keine Barrikaden, sondern nur die Kohlen am Köfte-Grill. Der Maifeiertag ist zu einer sozialdemokratischen Party geworden-Die WeltHier noch einige audiovisuelle Eindrücke:",

        "content": "Nach dem Tag in Bethlehem und in Hebron, geht es nun von Jerusalem aus weiter nach Ramallah, der de facto Hauptstadt der palästinensischen Autonomiegebiete. Ich bin gespannt, wie es dort genau sein wird. Denn Ramallah soll das kulturelle und intellektuelle Zentrum der Westbank sein. Wir nehmen einen Bus der arabischen Buslinie “Egged”, die auch am Freitag fährt. Ja, in der Tat ist es so, dass es einen Unterschied macht, ob man mit einer “jüdischen oder arabischen Buslinie” fährt. Allein diese Rubriken erscheinen mir im Bezug auf Unternehmen so absurd, dass ich sie vorsichtshalber in Anführungszeichen gesetzt habe. Die Fahrt kostet grade einmal zwei Euro und dauert etwa eine Stunde. Wie schon zuvor stelle ich fest, dass die Grenzüberquerung in die Westbank erstaunlich einfach und ohne jegliches Hindernis möglich ist.Über Couchsurfing konnte ich eine gleichaltrige Palästinenserin dafür gewinnen, ein wenig von ihrer Stadt und ihrem Leben als Studentin in Ramallah zu zeigen. Sie studiert &ldquo;english literature&rdquo;. Ihr Berufswunsch ist, später einmal Übersetzerin zu werden. Sie spricht ein einwandfreies Englisch. Bemerkenswerterweise spricht fast so ziemlich jeder Palästinenser Englisch, mit wenigen Ausnahmen (Achtung: Privatempirie!). Wir haben uns um 9:30 an der Bushaltestelle verabredet. Und ohne gewusst zu haben, wie lang die Fahrt genau dauert, sind wir auch tatsächlich exakt zur vereinbarten Zeit an der Haltestelle. Aus dem Fenster erkenne ich Dalal auch recht schnell. Sie ist ein schlankes nicht kleines, aber auch nicht großes, hübsches Mädchen. Sie trägt die hier übliche Kopfbedeckung, den Hijab, was durch die westliche Jeans kontrastiert wird. Das fällt schnell auf, circa 80 Prozent der Mädchen tragen den Hijab (deutsche Schreibung: Hidschāb), die in meinen Augen sogar ziemlich schön aussehen kann (Deutlich besser als manch alberne Kopfbedeckung, die sich Mädels in Berlin ohne religiösen Hintergrund auf ihr Haupt setzten). Doch auch fällt auf, dass die Mädchen abgesehen von dem Hijab sehr westlich gekleidet sind. Hautenge Jeans und Oberteile scheinen hier toleriert zu werden. Manche Mädchen sind auch komplett westlich gekleidet ohne Anzeichen eines muslimischen oder arabischen Einflusses. Für die Jungen ist die Sache einfacher, diese sind fast ausnahmslos gekleidet wie ihr westliches Pendant. Nur bei den älteren Männern sind auch öfters einmal lange Bärte und traditionelle Kostüme und Kleidung zu sehen. Hier gibt es eine nette Übersicht, wie die Menschen denn so ticken und aussehen.Hier eine Studentin der Birzeit-Uni, mit dem dort dominierendem HidschãbWir fahren mit dem &ldquo;shared cab&rdquo;, dessen Funktionsweise sich mir erst zum Ende meines Ramallah-Aufenthalts vollends erschließt. Dazu später mehr (Teasing? - Als ob solche billigen Hütchenspielertricks nötig hätte!). Wir fahren und fahren, die Uni liegt in einem Vorort Ramallahs: in Birzeit. Daher auch der Name &ldquo;Birzeit university&rdquo;. Die Uni, erklärt Dalal uns, ist die beste in ganz Palästina und man muss sich die anfallenden Studiengebühren auch erstmal leisten können.Die Uni liegt inmitten der, mich komischerweise Iran assoziieren lassender, Berglandschaft. Nach dem Vorzeigen unserer Pässe, dürfen Pascal und ich den im gleißenden Sonnenschein erleuchteten Campus betreten. Es wuseln unzählige Studenten und Studentinnen über die Wege der Uni. Es gibt mehr Mädchen als Jungen. Die Jungen sehen ein wenig aus, wie man sich den Klischee-Hipster in Berlin ausmalt. Auch wenn es laut Dalal an der Uni einige ausländische Studenten gibt, sind es doch insgesamt nicht besonders viele, wie mich die Aufmerksamkeit, die uns zuteil kommt, vermuten lässt. Kaum haben wir uns ein wenig auf dem Campus umgesehen, den Kaffee — fragwürdiger Qualität — aus dem Automaten probiert, geht es auch schon mit der ersten Unterrichtsstunde los. Auf dem Stundenplan steht Philosophie. Natürlich auf Arabisch. Hier ist es so, dass die Studenten sich ein Fach auswählen können, aber dennoch verpflichtend Philosophie, Arabisch belegen müssen. Ähnlich, wie in Russland. Dafür gibt es in der Schule keinen Philosophieunterricht.Apropos Unterricht: Ich verstehe kein Wort, ausser mal ein vereinzeltes “Kant” oder “Camus” oder auch ”Hitler” und “Stalin”. Worum es wohl in dieser Stunde genau ging, vermag ich nicht zu beurteilen. Als der Professor nun darauf aufmerksam wird, dass zwei neue Studenten in seiner Klasse sind und diese offensichtlich Ausländer sind, lächelt er freudig und fragt uns auf Englisch woher wir denn kämen. Der Professor möchte wissen, wie die Universitäten in Deutschland denn seien. Außerdem erläutert er uns, dass die Berzeit-Universität eine der liberalsten des Landes sein, ganz ander als etwa in Bethlehem (Gelächter in der Klasse) oder in Hebron (Erneut Heiterkeit in der Klasse). Hier könne man über alles sprechen, an anderen Universitäten wäre dies nicht möglich, da die Studenten dort aus Protest dem Professor bei kontroversen Prozessen den Rücken kehren würden. Nach einer Weile fährt der Professor wieder mit dem Unterricht fort.Als der Unterricht zu Ende ist, teilt Dalal mit, dass die nächsten Klassen ausfallen. Daher setzen wir uns auf die Treppe vor der Fakultät und sprechen mit dort sitzenden Studenten. Pascal fängt wieder einmal eine Diskussion über die Existenz Gottes an. Ich spreche lieber über den Nahostkonflikt und dessen konkrete Auswirkungen auf den Alltag vor Ort. Was ich erfahre erschüttert mich und stimmt mich noch nachdenklicher als schon zuvor.Von Mutasem, so heißt der Student, erfahre ich, dass er ursprünglich aus Hebron stammt. Da ich mit Hebron in erster Linie die unangenehme Begegnung mit den dortigen Soldaten assoziiere, frage ich gleich, ob er schon eine Begegnung dieser Art hatte. Er lacht bloß amüsiert: “Of course”. Er berichtet, dass er schon einmal gesehen hat, wie ein Palästinensischer Jugendlicher angeschossen wurde. Ungläubig schaue ich Mutasem an und will genaueres erfahren. Der Jugendliche wohnte nahe der Siedlungsgrenze in einem der Häuser, die die Siedler den palästinensischen Besitzern abkaufen wollen. Der Jugendliche saß in einem Stuhl vor dem Haus als eine Gruppe bewaffneter Siedler in das palästinensische Gebiet kam. Irgendwie kam es zu einem Streit zwischen den Siedlern und dem Jugendlichen, der in einem Handgemenge gipfelte. Dann fiel plötzlich ein Schuss. Einer der Siedler hatte dem Jungendlichen ins Bein geschossen. Daraufhin kamen israelische Soldaten, die den Streit auflöste und die Siedler wieder ins Siedlungsgebiete eskortierten. Den Jugendlichen ließ man mit seiner Schussverletzung zurück. Zum Glück riefen dessen Eltern anschließend den Notarzt. Es komme öfters vor, dass eine Gruppe bewaffneter Siedler sich durch palästinensisches Gebiet bewege. Kein palästinensischer Polizist traue sich, einem Siedler auch nur ein Haar zu krümmen. Wenn ein Siedler Gewalttätig wird, rufen die palästinensischen Sicherheitskräfte lediglich den israelischen Kommandeur an, damit diese Soldaten schickt, die den Siedler zurückbringen. Dies alles erklärt Mutasem mir, natürlich kann ich diese Aussagen nicht alle auf ihren Wahrheitsgehalt hin überprüfen, aber ich vertraue Methusalem, er macht einen vertrauenswürdigen und ehrlichen Eindruck. Mich überrascht, wie ruhig und distanziert er über diese Dinge sprechen kann.Ich könnte noch ewig mit ihm weiter über den Nahostkonflikt sprechen, doch Mutasem muss zum Unterricht. Immerhin kommen wir so hernach in den Genuss des hiesigen Mensaessens, dass wahrhaftig nicht schlecht ist. Gut, von meiner Uni habe ich eine gewisse Anspruchslosigkeit über die Semester mit auf den Weg bekommen. Die Uni inmitten der bergigen iranesken Landschaft (klingt doof, Adjektivalternativvorschläge werden dankbar entgegengenommen). Danach sehen wir uns den Campus an: Zuerst gehen wir, ich bin nicht ganz unbeteiligt an dieser Wahl, in die Informatik-Fakultät der Birzeit-Universität. Die Fakultäten sehen hier architektonisch zumeist gleich aus. Diese Einhelligkeit, die in Deutschland eher nicht gegeben ist, spiegelt sich auch bei den Studenten wieder. Natürlich ist mein Auge noch nicht so geschult, wie das eines Einheimischen, dennoch versteige ich mich mal zu der These, dass die Studenten hier recht uniform, ja allesamt westlich, gekleidet sind. Mit ihren breitrandigen Brillen vermag ich den Vergleich mit dem Berliner Klischee-Hipster nicht von der Hand zu weisen. An meiner Universität sind in der Informatikfakultät eindeutige Nerd-Attribute auch an der Kleidung zu finden. Hier in Ramallah scheint der Kontakt zu “Hacker- und Nerdkultur”, wie sie sich in Deutschland und Amerika herausgebildet hat, nicht vorhanden zu sein. Dennoch gibt es in der Fakultät viele Studenten und Studentinnen, das Geschlechterverhältnis ist in etwa gleich. Insgesamt, gäbe es jedoch mehr Studentinnen, verrät mir Dalal. In der Fakultät gibt es neben älteren, aber immerhin nicht hochbetagten Computern, auch ein Labor für Projekte mit Quadrokoptern. Ob diese auch so hinreissend atemberaubende Manövrierfähigkeiten, wie die der ETH-Zürich, haben, sei dahingestellt. Nichtsdestoweniger hätte ich so etwas nicht erwartet.Neben ein paar anderen Fakultäten begehen wir noch die Hauptmensa, in der es, wie allenthalben in der Westbank, eine Unmenge an Süßigkeiten zu kaufen gibt. Auch einen eigenen Crepés-Stand kann die Unimensa ihr eigen nennen. Neben spaßigen Details, wie dem Arafat-Poster hinter dem Saftstand, wartet die studentische Zusammensetzung mit einigen Überraschungen auf: Ziemlich alle Studenten sind arabisch, weshalb ich und Pascal auch einige neugierige Blicke bemerken. Das Gros der Studenten ist weiblich und trägt den Hijab, der männliche Teil trägt ausnahmslos Jeans oder Chinohosen in Kombination mit Hemd, T-Shirt oder Pullover. Bei den Studentinnen gibt es frappierende Erscheinungsformen, wie die hijabtragende Studentin, die es sich nicht verbieten lässt mit einer den Propheten sicherlich wenig begeisternden Leggins durch die Mensa zu stolzieren. Oder auch die Studentinnen die zumindest äußerlich jegliche Verbindung zu ihren muslimischen Wurzeln abgelegt haben und ohne den Hijab und mit einem Kleidungsstil, wie man ihn eins zu eins in der “Glamour” oder dem ”Peek &amp; Kloppenburg”-Katalog wiederfinden würde. Dies sieht man sonst in der Westbank nicht, Ramallah ist eben liberaler als der Rest des Landes.Am Abend schickt Dalal mich und Pascal zu einer Veranstaltung des studentischen Umweltclubs der Universität. Dies für sich genommen ist schon bemerkenswert, ich hätte gedacht, dass Umweltprobleme in einer konfliktreichen Umgebung, wie dieser, eher nachrangig behandelt werden. Mindestens genauso bemerkenswert ist der Live-Auftritt eines Ingenieur-Masterabsolventen, der daneben auch noch Rapper ist. Sein Rhythmusgefühl und die arabische Sprache lassen mich trotz Sprachbarriere vor der Wortgewaltigkeit und Ausdruckskraft ehrfürchtig den Hut ziehen. Nachzuhören, wenn auch weniger emotional und aggressiv, sind ILL PAZ Werke hier.Fortsetzung folgt…",

        "content": "Eine kleine Anekdote darf hier nicht unterschlagen werden: Es begab sich, dass Pascal und ich wieder zurück in Jerusalem waren. Es war Freitag. Am nächsten Tag war Shabbat, weswegen die Straßen wie ausgestorben waren. Nur orthodoxe Juden auf dem Weg aus der Synagoge und Araber waren zu dieser Zeit auf den Straßen unterwegs, weil die meisten grade dem Shabat-Dinner frönten. Das Stichwort hierzu lautet lukullische Genüsse.Pascal und ich suchten grade nach einem Restaurant, als mir eine ältere Frau auf der Straße auffiel, weil sie uns beide anzustarren schien. Ich fühle mich aus irgendeinem Grund dazu bemüßigt, der Frau zu erklären, dass wir ein Restaurant suchen. Ihr Englisch scheint mehr schlecht als recht. Sie gestikuliert, zeigt auf ein Fenster im zweiten Stock, fuchtelt erneut wild und zeigt anschließend auf uns. Wir sind irritiert und erklären der Frau noch einmal, was wir wollen. Ihre darauf folgende Replik fällt exakt so aus, wie schon zuvor.Nun meine ich zu verstehen, wir sollen ihr helfen einen eingeklemmten Fensterrerolladen zu öffnen. Wozu bräuchte sie sonst zwei junge Männer? Noch dazu um diese Uhrzeit. Sie wird uns ja wohl kaum überfallen wollen. Oder warten dann hinter der Straßenecke ihre muskulösen und skrupellosen Enkel, die Omi blindlings gehorchen und uns nach aller Kunst zusammenpetern werden. Oder ist die ältere Dame stärker als sie scheint und wird uns gar höchstselbst verwemsen?Sie bedeutet uns ihr zu folgen, was wir dann auch tuen. Nach einer Weile finden wir uns in einem zappendusteren Treppenhaus wieder. Wir folgen der alten Dame in den dritten Stock. Wir gehen durch die offene Wohnungstür ins Innere einer mittelgroßen Etagenwohnung. Ich blicke bereits erwartungsvoll zu den Balkonfenstern, sehe aber kein Rollo! Nun betritt auch die (anscheinend) 40-jährige Tochter der Dame - samt Enkelsohn - das Zimmer. Was braucht sie uns, wenn ihre Tochter doch da ist? Rätsel über Rätsel.Die Dame bittet uns in einen dunklen Raum. Das Licht brennt nicht und nur die Straßenbeleuchtung wirft einen schwachen Schein auf die Küche, soviel konnte ich erkennen. Was nun, frage ich mich? Doch die betagte Dame zeigt bloß energisch auf den Lichtschalter! Pascal scheint schneller zu begreifen, was los ist, und dreht den Lichtschalter auf vollen Anschlag. Die Dame nickt zufrieden und bedankt sich bei uns. Ich bin von dem Vorgang so irritiert, dass eine betagte Dame samt Tochter und Enkelsohn nicht in der Lage sind, einen Lichtschalter zu betätigen und daher die Dame dafür zwei junge Menschen von der Straße in ihr Haus bittet. Skurril. Kurios. Abstrus. Wo ist hier bitte die versteckte Kamera?Erst beim Durchschreiten der Wohnungstürschwelle, durchzuckt mich ein Gedanke, der eine plausible Erklärung für diesen Vorgang liefert. Das irrationale Verhalten hat einen irrationalen Ursprung, der dem Leser bekannt sein mag. Da macht sich dann doch der kulturelle Unterschied auf konkreteste Weise bemerkbar, auch wenn sich Israel ansonsten recht ähnlich ausnimmt. Selbst mir der Erklärung im Kopf, erscheint mir der ganze Vorgang retrospektiv noch immer irrwitzig. Wer selbst nicht drauf kommt, dem sei dieser Link anempfohlen: Link",

        "content": "Nachdem uns Hamid schon mehrere Stunden herum führte nahmen wir nun auch physisch Abstand zu ihm. Er ging zum Beten in die Moschee und Pascal und ich erkundeten die Siedlungsgebiete. Als wir an den Grenzposten vorbeigehen, fragen diese bloß, woher wir den kämen. Als Pascal floskelhaft fragt, was sie denn hier täten, antworten diese lakonisch: &ldquo;We are here to protect you!&rdquo;. Keine Passkontrolle. Keine Befragung. Unsere Hautfarbe under Gesichtsphysiognomie sind unser Passierschein. Es ist komisch, so ziemlich alle Palästinenser, mit denen ich zuvor gesprochen habe, wären hier nicht durchgekommen. Ich bin mir nicht ganz sicher wie ich dieses Privileg genau bewerten kann. Die Soldaten sind nett und sind wie alle anderen auch Wehrdienstleistende vielleicht höchstens 19-jährige Jugendliche, die mit einer 40cm langen Maschinenpistole in voller Schutzmontur die Einfahrt zum Siedlungsgebiet bewachen.Wir betreten also das Siedlungsgebiet. Als erstes fällt auf, dass die Gebäude und Straßen in unmittelbarer Nähe zum palästinensischem Autonomiegebiet in einem heruntergekommenen Zustand sind. Es sieht ein wenig aus, wie in einer Geisterstadt. In Torbögen sind Betonklötze gestellt, welche den Zugang von außerhalb verhindern sollen. So wurde etwa ein Teilstück des Marktes abgeriegelt, um die Sicherheit der Grenze zu gewährleisten. Ich würde hier nicht wohnen wollen, allein schon aufgrund des ins Auge stechende Verfall. Viel Geld für Instandsetzung scheinen die Siedler nicht zu haben.Doch man sieht vereinzelt junge Kinder herumstreunen. Wir gehen durch unbenutzte verfallene Hallen, die vielleicht früher einmal arabische Marktstände beherbergten. Nun ist dort lediglich Geröll und Schutt. Als wir das Camp wieder verlassen, sollte mir noch auffallen, dass auf diesen Hallen nun auch ein Wachturm war. Ich hatte dies gar nicht bemerkt, doch dort standen sie die ganze Zeit, Soldaten mit geladenen Waffen. Bereit im Notfall von ihnen Gebrauch zu machen. Ich muss unwillkürlich zurück an meinen Besuch der Klagemauer zurückdenken, wo ja bekanntlich ein unbewaffneter erschossen wurde, nachdem er Allah Wahgba rief und in seine Jackentasche griff. Wie kann man seine Kinder in so einer Umgebung aufwachsen lassen?Wir schlendern noch eine Weile durch die Siedlung, deren Straßen mit Wachtürmen und Barrikaden gespickt ist. Wir folgen einer Straße bis zu einem Friedhof. Die arabischen Inschriften auf den Grabsteinen lassen erahnen, dass dies ein Friedhof der früher hier lebenden Araber gewesen seien muss.Wir treffen auf einen jungen Mann, der grade aus einem Haus, welches direkt an der Grenze steht kommt und sprechen ihn an. Dieser gibt auch bereitwillig Auskunft, so erfahren wir, dass Aaron Musiker ist und grade für eine Familie gespielt hat. Er ist selbst jedoch auch Siedler. Ich frage ihn, wie er so leben kann, mit all den Waffen und dem ständigen Befürchten eines Angriffs. Er erklärt, dass er in einer Siedlung geboren wurde und es für ihn ganz normal sei. Als Pascal nachfragt, wie Aaron den Konflikt sieht, antwortet er ganz offen: &ldquo;We were here 2000 years ago. Did you know that Jews used to live here and owned this markets, and then they were expelled? Our ancestors lived here and now we returned.&rdquo;. Auch auf Stellen in Bibel und Thora verweist Aaron zur Begründung des Besitzanspruches. Zudem sei man mit dem Auto in sehr kurzer Zeit in Jerusalem, auch wenn Palästinenser zum Teil Autos mit Steinen bewürfen. Und er erzählt, dass den Palästinensern für die Häuser zum Teil immense Summen geboten werden, insbesondere in der Nähe zu Jerusalem. Einige Palästinenser leben nun in den USA, weil sie ihr Haus für enormen Erlös verkauft haben. Viele Palästinenser schlagen aber auch jegliches Kaufangebot, sei es noch so hoch, aus (Wie der Hausbesitzer, dessen Frau erschossen wurde). Und auf Nachfrage gibt Aaron uns seine Einschätzung der religiösen Ursachen des Konflikts: &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s also about religion. Islam and Judaism share a lot of sacred sites. Like here with the grave of Abraham.&rdquo; Tatsächlich teilen sich hier Juden und Muslime dieses Heiligtum. So kann man, wenn man in die Synoge geht, auch den Muezzin rufen hören, weil die Moschee direkt angrenzt. Leider kommen wir nicht mehr dazu, seine Bewertung der Tatsache, dass die Siedlungen de jure laut Völkerrecht illegal sind, zu hören. Immerhin bekommen wir noch eine CD mit einer Auswahl seiner Lieder geschenkt.Als wir die Siedlung wieder verlassen, gehe ich mit dem Gefühl hinaus, dass nach der Unterzeichnung eines Friedensvertrags die Mauern und Wachtürme nicht einfach wieder abgebaut werden können, falls eine flämische-belgische Lösung angestrebt würde. Also eine, bei der die Siedler als Israelis mit Wohnsitz im Ausland in Palästina verblieben. Die Verwerfungen, der Hass und das Misstrauen auf beiden Seiten scheinen mir zu stark als dass hier alle problemlos friedlich miteinander auskämen.",

        "content": "Am nächsten Tag fahren wir mit einem Mehrpersonentaxi nach Hebron, da aufgrund des muslimischen Ruhetags am Freitag keine Busse verkehren.Es ist schon eine bizarre Koinzidenz, dass die Muslime Freitag ruhen, die Juden am Samstag und die Christen am Sonntag. Würde man alle Seiten gleichberechtigt behandeln, so müsste man 3 Feiertage pro Woche postulieren. Sicher nicht zuträglich für die Produktivität, aber ein Gedanke mit dem ich mich anfreunden könnte. Aber ich schweife ab. Wir fahren also nach Hebron und Hamid begleitet uns freundlicherweise. Er weißt uns auf verschiedene Besonderheiten entlang der Fahrtroute hin. So erblickte ich in der Ferne zum ersten Mal in meinem Leben eine der illegalen israelischen Siedlungen in der Westbank. Doch ich sollte ihnen im Laufe des Tages näher kommen, als ich es jemals für möglich hielt. Die Straßen sind von Wachtürmen aus unter Beobachtung. Hier auf dem Land sind diese zusätzlich mit Betonhindernissen und Stacheldrähten abgesichert, da die Landbevölkerung eher zu Aufständen neigt, als die Stadtbevölkerung. Noch bemerkenswerter finde ich hingegen, dass die Straße, die wir befahren, sowohl von Israelis als auch von Palästinensern befahren wird. Hier kommt man also immerhin miteinander aus.Als wir in den nördlichen Teil Hebrons kommen, warnt ein Schild, dass man nun autonomes palästinensisches Gebiet betrete und es Israelis verboten ist diese zu betreten. Wir betreten eine sogenannte &ldquo;A area&rdquo;. Mittlerweile komme ich auch mit der Einteilung der Westbankgebiete in &ldquo;A/B/C/H1/H2 areas&rdquo; zurecht. Schilder, wie dieses, sind etwa an von Siedlern bewohnten Häusern und an Teilen der Mauer zu finden.In Hebron schlendern wir ein wenig durch die recht leere 100.000 Einwohner zählende Stadt. Es ist muslimischer Ruhetag, daher die Leere. Schließlich gehen wir in die Altstadt, wo uns Hamid mit einem Schüler von ihm - Aiman - die israelischen Siedlungen mitten in der Altstadt zeigt. Dies ist, was Hebron zu einem Ort macht, der den Konflikt konkret veranschaulicht. Siedler hätten hier die ursprünglich wohnenden Palästinenser vertrieben, erläutert Aiman. Viele Läden mussten schließen, da die IDF aus Sicherheitsgründen Gebiete absperrt. Man geht durch die Altstadt und neigt man seinen Kopf ein wenig gen Himmel erblickt man Stacheldraht und Wachtürme - schon wieder ein Bild, dass sich einem einprägt und wie schierer Wahnsinn erscheint. Wer sperrt wen aus und wen ein? Hier leben Palästinenser und Siedler so nah beieinander, jedoch hermetisch abgetrennt. Israelis kämen nicht in den palästinenschen Teil erklärt Aiman. Die Gitter über den Gassen dienten zum Schutz vor Steinwürfen der Siedler, die die Häuser auf einer Seite der Gasse bewohnen. Dies komme manchmal vor, erklärt Hamid. Nach einer Weile führen uns Schüler und Lehrer (Hamid und Amman) in die Wohnung eines Palästinensers, der direkt neben den Siedlern wohnt. Aiman erzählt, dass die Frau des Hausbesitzers 2008 erschossen wurde. Erst auf nachhaken unsererseits erfahren wir, dass (laut Aiman) die Frau auf das Dach des Hauses ging, um die dortigen Wasserreservoirs zu kontrollieren. Daraufhin wäre sie von israelischen Soldaten mit 5 Schüssen erschossen worden. Auch der gemeinsame Sohn sei von Soldaten angegriffen worden und habe nun ein Sehleiden. Ob sie eine Klage angestrengt haben, wollen wir wissen und erfahren, dass es versucht worden sei, aber eh zu nichts führen würde. &ldquo;The high court will always be on the Israeli side&rdquo; meint Aiman. Zudem meint er: &ldquo;the European media is controlled by the zionist movement&rdquo;, was evident eine haltlose Konspirationstheorie ist. Dennoch differenziert Aiman immerhin zwischen Zionisten und Juden. Auch das Existenzrecht Israels und die Zweistaatenlösung akzeptiert er vorbehaltlos, doch sein späteres Verhalten gibt mir Grund dies in Zweifel zu ziehen. Er könnte womöglich auch den Wolf im Schafspelz spielen und seine wahren Absichten hinter einer gemässigten Fassade verkappen. Seine manchmal platte und krude Argumentation mag vielleicht auch dem Umstand geschuldet sein, dass er die Westbank noch nie verlassen hat bzw. konnte. So versteigt sich Aiman doch tatsächlich zu dem irrwitzigen Statement Pascal gegenüber: &ldquo;I study psychology, that&rsquo;s why i can tell two things about you:  You are clever and you have jewish parts in your family. Or jewish cousins.&rdquo;. Immerhin fügt er noch an: &ldquo; But that&rsquo;s ok. I have nothing against that.&rdquo;. Am Schluss unseres Besuchs erfahren wir noch, dass - wie schon in Bethlehem - der Hausbesitzer vehement Kaufangebote der israelischen Regierung verweigert. Seine Frau wurde auf dem Dach erschossen und sein Sohn wurde attackiert und dennoch wohnt der Mann weiterhin im selben Haus. Man kann ihn, ob seiner Verbissenheit bewundern oder auch bemitleiden. Ich vermag mich nicht zwischen diesen beiden Möglichkeiten zu entscheiden. Wundern sollte ich mich so oder so über eine Seite Aimans, die ich für weniger ausgeprägt hielt.Wir planen uns zum Busbahnhof zu begeben, um wieder nach Bethlehem zu zurückzufahren. Auf dem Weg passieren wir einer in Stellung befindlicher Streitkräftedivision, die grade eine Mission ausführt. Pascal fragt einen Soldaten, ob dies eine Übung sei, was im Nachhinein eine eindeutig überflüssige Frage war, da diese sich sicherlich nicht für eine Übung in Gefahr begeben. Die Soldaten antworten auch nicht auf die Frage, sondern bedeuten uns, dass wir passieren dürfen. Wenige Meter hinter der Soldatenansammlung treffen wir Aiman wieder. Dieser und Pascal verwickeln sich in ein Gespräch, da Pascal verlangt, dass Aiman erklären soll, weshalb er zu wissen glaubt Pascal sei jüdisch. Aiman setzt ein schiefes Lächeln auf und mändert um eine ehrliche Antwort herum. Schließlich gibt er doch Preis, was seinen Wahn erklärt: Pascal stände auf der israelischen Seite. Weil Pascal im vorangegangenen Gespräch kritische Fragen gestellt hatte, lautete der simplizistische Kurzschluss nun, er wäre gegen Palästinenser. Die Schwarzweißlogik von, die hier offenbar wurde, war schon leicht beängstigend. Wer kritische Fragen stellt ist nicht für mich und somit gegen mich. Sukzessive kam mehr und mehr die absolut aberwitzige Motivation Aimans zum Vorschein. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on a mission. My mission is to defend my country.&rdquo;. Diese Mission habe er aus der Koranschule. Langsam bestätig ich, was ich vorher bloß ahnte. Es scheint so als ob Hamid Ausländer aufgreift, um sie von seiner Sicht des Konflikts zu überzeugen. Ich würde fast soweit gehen, dass er dies auch religiös motiviert tut. Die Disput zwischen Aiman und Pascal kulminiert dann doch tatsächlich darin, dass Aiman ihn beschuldigt ein Spion zu sein: &ldquo;You come here to get information. You can tell your people we will struggle, we are strong, we don&rsquo;t give up!&rdquo;.Die nur einen Steinwurf entfernt (diese Redewendung passt erschreckend gut auf die Situation&hellip;) anwesenden Soldaten in voller Montur mit Maschinengewehren, die die Augen jedes Waffenfetischisten zum glühen brächten, bringen mich lediglich in einen nervösen Zustand. Das ist kein Spaß, diese Soldaten haben scharfe MunitionPlötzlich hebt der uns am nächstem stehende Soldat sein Maschinenpistole und zielt damit - an uns vorbei - auf etwas in die Ferne, dass ich nicht ausmachen kann. Ich Folge weiter der Auseinandersetzung mit Aiman. Als ich meinen Blick erneut schweifen lasse gewahre ich nicht unweit ein aufblitzendes gelbes T-Shirt. Es ist ein Jugendlicher, der mit einem Stein nach den Soldaten wirft. Jetzt wird mir klar, dass das Anlegen der Waffe einen konkreten Grund hatte. Die Lage wird mir langsam zu brenzlig, hier zwischen die Fronten zu geraten ist nun wirklich nicht meine Absicht.Ich spüre wie sich mein Puls beschleunigt, ich dränge Aiman, dessen ebenfalls anwesenden Freund und Pascal dazu, besser aufzubrechen. Aiman teilt daraufhin mit &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fear them. I have five bullets in me. I would stand right before them.&rdquo;. Diese Aussage stimmt mich nun noch nachdenklicher als schon der Rest sowieso. Auch sein ständiges Gefasel von seiner Mission, sein Freund-Feind-Denken und nun diese Aussage geben einen gewissen Grad des Fanatismus zu erkennen, der einem nur unheimlich sein kann. Eine gewisse geistige Schlichtheit möchte ich Aiman nicht einmal unterstellen. Wenn man den Alltag eines besetzten Landes erlebt, wenn im Umfeld Menschen sterben, wenn man das Land unmöglich verlassen kann, wenn Soldaten mit Waffen tagtäglich durch die Straßen ziehen, dann schafft dies eine gefährliche Situation, die Gefahr läuft Fanatisierung zu provozieren. Ich nehme noch das bedrückend beeindruckende Bild von der Mutter mit ihren zwei höchstens 8-jährigen Kindern mit, die die Straße entlang direkt an den Soldaten mit Waffe im Anschlag vorbeiläuft. Sie schaut die Soldaten nicht an, die Kinder ignorieren die Soldaten ebenfalls geflissentlich. Werden diese Kinder Israelis nur in Uniform kennenlernen? Diese traurige Frage stelle ich mir. All der Hass und die Bitternis, die die Besatzung nun aufstauen lässt, hoffentlich wird sie ein Friedensabkommen mit der Zeit vergessen machen können.&lt;class=&ldquo;caption&rdquo; p&gt;Da in Hebron für Juden eine religiöse Bedeutung hat, haben sich die Siedler hierher begeben. Hier liegen Moschee und Synagoge direkt nebeneinanderNach diesem Tag meine ich zu verstehen, weshalb die Israelis bzw. die Siedler eine Mauer aufgezogen haben und weshalb die Palästinenser die Besetzung so emphatisch beklagen. Ganz unabhängig von dem Richtig und Falsch auf beiden Seiten. ",

        "content": "Nach zwei Nächten in einem Hostel in Jerusalem, weil die Hosts von Couchsurfing leider absagen mussten ging es dann tatsächlich für mich zum ersten mal in die Westbank. Und zwar nach Bethlehem. Was ich als recht naiver und zugegebenermaßen uninformierten erwartete, waren ein paar christliche Heiligtümer und eine vielleicht auch noch reizvolle Berglandschaft. Was ich dann aber tatsächlich zu Gesicht bekam, hatte ich nicht erwartet. Unter anderem zählte eine im wortwörtlichsten Sinne reizende Begegnung mit Tränengas zu den Erfahrungen des Tages, die ich - neben vielen anderen - mitnehmen durfte. Eine der unangenehmeren, wie man sagen muss. Die konkrete und und nicht glanzvolle Realität des Konflikts im Nahen Osten, der seit einem halben Jahrhundert besteht, bisweilen nur als glimmenden Glut, dann aber auch wieder als blutrot lodernde Flamme, die unzählige Opfer forderte und nur schwer - und völlig schon gar nicht - zu löschen ist.Von einer Reise in die Westbank rieten mir in Israel viele ab, andere ermunterten mich hingegen mich auch dort einmal umzusehen. Bei Gesprächen mit Israelis in ungefähr meinem Alter kam erstaunlich oft, wenn ich sie nach der Westbank fragte, die Antwort sie seien bereits dort gewesen. In den allermeisten Fällen als Soldaten der IDF (Israeli Defense Force). Bethlehem wurde von den meisten - weil touristisch erschlossen - als unbedenklich eingestuft. Bei Ramallah rieten schon mehr von einem Besuch ab. Die Begründung lautete, dass es nachts Operationen der IDF gibt, die der Verhaftung palästinensischer Terroristen dient. Zudem gebe es eine Minderheit extrem radikaler und fanatischer Kräfte, die so irrationale Gedanken hegen, dass ihnen alle zugetraut werden muss. Selbst Anschläge oder Entführungen von Nicht-Israelis seien von solchen Kräften zu erwarten.Nun ja, deshalb ging es - eigentlich mehr dem Zufall geschuldet - erstmal nach Bethlehem, wo ich - wie bereits erwähnt - ein pittoreskes Glaubens-Disneyland für einfältige Touristen erwartete. In Jerusalem traf ich während einer Kneipen-Tour einen Schweizer - den Pascal -, der auch in die Westbank wollte und schließlich beschlossen wir gemeinsam nach Bethlehem und hernach nach Ramallah zu fahren. Er hatte so wie ich die erste Hälfte seiner Zeit in Israel verbracht und war nun neugierig auf die andere Seite geworden. Eine Reise nach Israel, die nicht politisch ist, wäre ein wenig so, wie mit dem Flugzeug zu fliegen, den ganzen Flug über die Augen zu verschließen und zu ignorieren, dass man sich auf 10.000 Metern Höhe befindet. Dann darf man sich nachher auch nicht wundern, dass man nicht versteht, was das Ruckeln und Wackeln zu bedeuten hat, wenn es plötzlich jäh in die eigene kleine Blase einzubrechen droht.Wie auch immer. Auf jeden Fall beginnt die Reise gegen Zwölf am Damaskustor in Jerusalem, wo die Busse der arabischen Busfirmen abfahren. Die Fahrt kostet grade 8 Schekel und bringt einen in circa 30 Minuten nach Betlehem. Die Fahrt über die Grenze verläuft als würde man von Deutschland in die Niederlande fahren. Abgesehen von streckenweise Mauerstreifenversatzstücken und einer Grenzkontrolle, die beim Verlassen Israels jedoch nicht zum Tragen kommt. Irgendwann merkt man, dass die Menschen in den Städten keine Kippa oder jüdisch-orthodoxe Tracht mehr tragen und die Beschilderung der Läden vollkommen arabisch ist. Die jüdisch-orthodoxen werden hier im Straßenbild nahtlos durch die muslimischen Gelehrten und Muhezine - die mit nicht minder auffälliger Tracht aufwarten - ersetzt. Irgendwann sind wir dann plötzlich in Betlehem.An der Bushaltestelle werden wir von Taxifahrern umworben als währen wir vogelfrei. Anscheinend machten wir einen zu touristischen Eindruck. Am Ende fanden wir einen Taxifahrer, der nicht nur wie ein arabischer “Bruce Willis”-Verschnitt aussah, sondern uns auch eine Rundfahrt zu einem horrenden Preis aufschwatzen wollte. Erfolglos, wie ich festhalten möchte! Das Hostel in dem wir nächtigten heißt “Peace Hostel” und ist absolut uneingeschränkt weiterzuempfehlen. Das Hostel ist im Wohnhaus einer lokalen Familie untergebracht und wird von ihnen betrieben, was dazu führt, dass man sich schnell sehr heimisch fühlt. Die Familie ist - wie viele in Betlehem - christlich. Noch erstaunlicher ist, dass der Chef deutsch spricht, weil er dies in einer lutherischen Bibelschule gelernt hat. Religiösität hat hier in der Familie einen hohen Stellenwert. Die Preise sind auch fair und fallen mit 70 Schekel die Nacht überschaubar aus.Nach dem wir uns eingerichtet haben, beschließen Pascal et moí uns in die Stadt zu begeben, um etwas von Betlehem zu sehen und mindestens genauso wichtig: ausschweifend zu schlemmen und uns mit den lokalen Spezialitäten zu verköstigen. Gesagt getan, lokale kulinarische Kleinode, wie etwa das Humous, die Falafel und Salate, sind die Reise allein schon wert, wie wir beide konstatieren mussten. Anschließenden irrten äh liefen wir eine ganze Weile ziellos durch die Stadt, bis wir irgendwann die touristischen Viertel hinter uns ließen und dafür zwar öfters voll Skepsis beäugt wurden, aber so auch einmal die größtenteils authentische Atmosphäre des Ortes erspüren konnten. Die touristisch hochfrequentierten Orte schienen tatsächlich mehr ein Zerrbild des restlichen Betlehem zu sein, das meiner Disneyland-Vorstellung schon nahe kam. Allein schon, weil einen nicht jeder Händler und Taxifahrer von der Seite anpimmelt, nur weil man als Nicht-Einsässiger scheinbar für einige für Vogelfrei erklärt ist. Am Anfang ist es ja noch ganz unterhaltsam und eine nette Herausforderung übergriffig-aufdringliche Verkaufsangebote jedweder Art abzuwimmeln, mit der Zeit wird es allerdings immer mehr zum lästigen Erinnerung daran, dass man nicht dazugehört, dass man in den Augen mancher der dumme Tourist ist, der um sein Geld erleichtert werden will. Ist man hingegen in den Vierteln, wo nur noch Araber unterwegs sind entfällt dieses unangenehme Phänomen vollends.Nach einer Weile bummeln durch die Stadt, wollen wir zur Grenzmauer, deren Besuch uns der verkaufsfräudige Taxifahrer unter Anderem aufschwatzen wollte. Wir hatten erst einmal genug von der Stadt gesehen, auch wenn sie neben historischer, wunderschöner und schlicht verkommener Architektur vom orientalischen Gemüsemarkt - wie aus einem Film kopiert - bis hin zu den - von Händlern gesäumten - engen, verschlungenen Gassen, einiges zu bieten hat. Also nahmen wir ein Taxi, handelten erst einmal den Preis auf ein nur noch zu hohes Niveau (statt viel zu hohes) hinunter und ließen uns an die Mauer bringen. Das kolossale Bauwerk mit einer Höhe von gut eineinhalb dutzend Metern Höhe bietet der Berliner Mauer mühelos Paroli. Die Mauer ist auf großen Teilen des Verlaufes mit Grafittibemalung übersäht. Vom lakonischen Halbsatz bis hin zu Großzeichnungen, die den Betrachter mit ihren emotionalen Motiven und ihrer eindrücklichen Ästhetik fesseln und in den Bann ziehen.Nach einer Weile des von Motiv zu Motiv wechselnd treffen wir auf einen Herrn mittleren Alters mit einer Kamera. Er spricht uns an und erklärt, dass er in Hebron wohnt und jeden Donnerstag nach Betlehem kommt, um zu schauen, wie sich die Lage hier verändert hat. Er bietet uns an, uns ein wenig herumzuführen. Wir nehmen das Angebot dankend an. Wir erfahren, dass Bazaam Physik- und Mathematik-Lehrer ist und uns interessante Stellen an der Mauer, den Checkpoint nach Jerusalem und zwei Flüchtlingscamps zeigen will. Als erstes wandern wir eine Weile an der Mauer entlang, die mit ihren Wachtürmen das Gefühl, Insasse einer Hochsicherheitsgefängnisses zu sein, hervorruft. Irgendwann kommen wir an einer besonderen Stelle der Mauer an: Hier ist ein Haus an drei Seiten von der Mauer umschlossen. Bazaam erklärt, das die Israelis das Land an dieser Stelle wollten, weil hier ein für sie religiös bedeutsamer Ort ist. Weil man wohl doch Skrupel hatte, das Haus abzureißen, baute man die Mauer einfach drumherum. Der Besitzer - Hamid - betreibt darin nun das Hostel mit dem zynischen Namen “Hostel at the wall” und verkauft Souvenirs in einem ebenfalls dem Haus angegliederten Laden. Dort bekommen wir die Gelegenheit mit ihm zu spreche. So erfahren wir, dass der Bau der Mauer nur 3 Monate dauerte und, dass die israelische Regierung sein Haus kaufen möchte, er aber die Angebote ablehnt. Er ist hier aus Prinzip sagt er, er könne auch nicht woanders hinziehen, dann würde das Haus auch abgerissen und die Aussparung für das Haus in der Mauerführung geschlossen. Weiter erklärt er, wie der Mauerbau seine Familie gespalten hat: Sein Vater wohnt 400m Luftlinie von ihm, aber weil die Mauer das Haus des Vaters abtrennt, kommt Hamid nur zwei mal im Jahr dazu seinen Vater zu besuchen. Es sei den Palästinensern, nur zwei mal im Jahr gestattet die Grenze zu passieren. Man müsse Anträge stellen. Wer hingegen einer Arbeit in Jerusalem nachgehe bekomme eine Sondererlaubnis erklärt Hamid. Das Thema regt ihn sichtlich auf. “They don’t want us, because they think we are terrorists” entgegnet Hamid aufgebracht. An einer Stelle der, die das Haus umschließenden Mauer, kann man durch eine Ritze in der verrutschten Mauernut wieso das Land so wichtig war, dass man dafür eine so absurde Mauerführung in Kauf nahm. Durch die Ritze kann man einige Männer ausmachen, die - sich verneigend - dem Gebet nachgehen. Religiöse Freiheit für die einen, Bewegungsunfreiheit für den anderen.Anschließend gehen wir zum Checkpoint, auf dem Weg kommen wir an einem riesigen Tor vorbei, dass in seiner Mauerhöhe absurd groß aussieht und ist. Solche Riesentore kannte ich bisher nur aus Spielfilmen. “That’s where they come out with their tanks and jeeps” erklärt Hamid. Am Checkpoint angelangt bin ich wiederum positiv überrascht. Vor dem Checkpoint haben sich Gemüsehändler niedergelassen und verkaufen Waren an die zum Feierabend nach Betlehem zurückkehrenden Palästinenser. Der Checkpoint dezimiert - wie die massive Mauer auch - das Gefühl der eigenen Freiheit auf bedrückende Weise. Durch einen langen vergitterten Gang gelangt man zu einem Durchlass in der Mauer, wo sich ein kleines Kontrollhäuschen, wie die Passkontrolle am Flughafen - befindet. In dem Häuschen versieht ein junger, sympathisch wirkender - vielleicht 18-Jähriger - Israeli seien Dienst. Als wir uns schließlich auf dem Weg zum Flüchtlingscamp AIDA machen, erklärt uns Hamid, dass er die Intifada hier miterlebt hat und dass er damals einen ganz normalen Alltag erlebt hat, es gab lediglich mehr Checkpoints und Kontrollen durch die IDF.Zynischerweise muss man das pompös-protzige Grand Hyatt Bethlehem passieren, um in das Flüchtlingscamp AIDA zu gelangen. Auf dem Weg übersetzt und Hamid einige Graffitis, die allesamt barbarische Absichten Israelis gegenüber zum Ausdruck bringen. So lautet ein Graffiti etwa: “Tot für die Getöteten”, was eine klarer Aufruf Rachegelüsten freien lauf zu lassen, den ich nun für völlig falsch halte. Gleichzeitig geben diese Graffitis auch Aufschluss über die Gemütslage der hier lebenden Menschen. Es sind hauptsächlich aus Israel vertriebene Palästinenser, die in diese Camps ziehen mussten. Die Camps stehen unter Aufsicht der UN, wobei die IDF hier auch patrouilliert. Der Grund und Boden gehört ebenfalls der UN. Als wir bei den ersten Häusern des Camps sind, hält ein uns entgegenkommender Kleinbus und der Fahrer warnt vor “Israeli soldiers are around the corner. They are using tear gas” (Wie Hamid uns übersetzt). Wir gehen vorsichtig weiter, als nicht unweit dumpfe Explosionen hörbar werden und wir im Dunkel der Nacht Blaulicht und Soldaten in Schutzmontur erblicken fährt mir ein kalter Schauer über den Rücken, so unmittelbar bin ich noch nie Zeuge von der Ausübung von Staatsgewalt geworden.Hamid vermutet, dass Jugendliche wieder Steine werfen und sich eine Schlacht mit der IDF liefern. In den letzten Wochen sei es wieder verstärkt zu Spannungen gekommen. Wir biegen eine Straße vor der ab, an dem die Soldaten in Deckung hinter ihrem Auto versuchen die Lage in den Griff zu bekommen. Dort begegnen wir einer Muslima die fragt “How many soldiers are there? Are there many soldiers?”. Sie macht dabei einen besorgten Gesichtsausdruck wird dann aber entspannter als Hamid erklärt: “Just a few.”. Nicht hektisch aber geschwind geht sie in das Haus einige Meter weiter. Sie wohnt hier schon immer erklärt Hamid. Wir gehen weiter die Straße entlang, die Häuser stehen so eng im Spalier, dass es vielmehr eine Gasse ist.Schon nach kurzer Zeit kommt uns eine Gruppe junger Mädchen entgegen, die sich den Mund mit Hand und Pullovern bedecken. Leicht irritiert frage ich mich, was sie damit bezwecken, als ich eine beißendes Brennen an Augen und Mund bemerke. Es ist das Tränengas, dass hier verschossen wird. Die Intensität des Brennens nimmt zu, daher beschließen wir kehrt zu machen und in ein anderes Flüchtlingscamp zu gehen.Fortsetzung folgt später, wenn ich genug Zeit habe, auch mit dem Teil zu Israel, der schon fast fertig ist&hellip;",

        "content": "Rolf Mützenich war lange Zeit aussenpolitischer Sprecher der SPD-Fraktion. Inzwischen ist er zum stellvertretenden Fraktionsvorsitzenden gewählt worden. Er macht einen soliden, gefestigten Eindruck. Er redet ruhig und klar und weiß die Aufmerksamkeit des Zuhörers aufrechtzuerhalten. Bemerkenswert ist seine Uneitelkeit und sein anscheinend nicht vorhandenes Ego. So fragt er in der Diskussion in seinen Antworten auch mal nach: “Weißt du dazu vielleicht mehr?”. Und diese Frage meint er unzweifelhaft ganz ernst. Er schafft es die Sachverhalte in einem ruhigen Tonfall mit einer klaren Sprache zu vermitteln.Es wurde laut Mützenich 2001/2002 eine große Chance vertan, als die Arabische Liga die von Israel vorgeschlagene Zwei-Staaten-Lösung ausschlug. So wurden die zwei Staaten in den Grenzen von 1967 nicht realisiert. Seitdem hat sich die Lage weiter zugespitzt. Interessanterweise ist China bereit die USA bei ihren Bemühungen um die Herbeiführung einer Lösung des Konfliktes herbeizuführen. Nach Mützenichs Eindruck ist die “Volksrepublik China” bereit sich in dieser Frage zu positionieren. Ihn persönlich erinnert eine Option, wie die Kennzeichnungspflicht von israelischen Siedlungsgebieteprodukten, vor dem Hintergrund der deutschen Geschichte all zu sehr an den Holocaust. Zudem ist Mützenich entsetzt, wie wenig beide Seiten des Konflikts doch von einander wissen. Die immer weiter vorangetriebene Abschottung der Westbank von Israel hat dazu geführt, dass viele Israelis und Palästinenser nicht mehr wissen, wie der jeweilig andere lebt, wie dessen Lebensrealität eigentlich aussieht.Die Uneindeutigkeit des Konflikts und die Schwierigkeit Mützenichs in einer Schwarz-Weiß-Logik zu verfallen wird deutlich, wenn er sagt: “Wenn ich mit den Palästinensern rede, denke ich : Die haben recht! Sie haben ein Gebiet, welches immer stärker von Siedlungen durchsetzt wird, das muss aufhören. Wenn ich mit den Israelis rede, denke ich: Meine Güte! Die haben recht! Israel ist ein kleiner Staat und hat aufgrund seiner Lage und Geschichte spezielle Sicherheitsbedürfnissse.” Weiter erwartet Mützenich eine heftige innenpolitische Debatte, falls es zu einer Lösung mit einer entmilitarisierten Zone, die von der UN gesichert wird. Deutschland wurde von Israel ja schon einmal gebeten bei der Sicherung von entmilitarisierten Zonen mitzuwirken. Bei Scheitern der Verhandlungen ist laut Mützenich mit einer Zeit des Stillstands, gar des Rückschritts mit Anschlägen zu rechnen.Auf die Frage, ob China in 10 Jahren die Rolle der USA einnehmen könnte, da China nicht nur aufstrebende Macht, sondern auch mehr Glaubwürdigkeit besitzt, antwortet Mützenich, dass er dies nicht wisse. So nimmt China heute schon eine wichtige Rolle bei dem Konflikt zwischen Nord- und Südsudan ein. Konkret verhindert China dort, dass beide Parteien übereinander herfallen. Allerdings ist die Glaubwürdigkeit Chinas auch skeptisch zu sehen, da es selbst etwa Tibet besetzt und selbst auch keine Vorzeigedemokratie ist. Weiter erklärt Mützenich, dass der soziale Frieden bei einem verhandelten Frieden sich nur bei massiver internationaler Unterstützung stabilisieren lässt.Eine weiterer interessantes Faktum ist die Tatsache, dass Rolf Mützenich Kontakt zu Gruppierungen, wie der Hamas, pflegt. Die Hamas will den Kontakt zur deutschen Regierung, diese kann jedoch keinen Kontakt herstellen, weil diese offiziell nicht mit der Hamas spricht, da diese als terroristische Vereinigung geächtet wird. Der “workaround” an dieser Stelle ist, dass man sich als Parlamentarier mit der Hamas trifft. Als solcher übt man das freie Mandat aus und kann reisen und sprechen mit wem man will. “Wenn die Regierung nicht mit ihnen verhandelt, dann machen wir’s”. So fährt Mützenich zu Gesprächen mit der Hamas, Gruppierungen in Iran und berichtet anschließend Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Interessant ist auch die Erzählung von einem Vorfall, bei dem ein Deutscher aus Rheinland-Pfalz sich mit einem Motorboot verfahren hatte und in iranischen Gewässern landete. Dort wurde er von iranischen Sicherheitskräften aufgegriffen und im Anschluss der Spionage angeklagt. Nachdem er tatsächlich zu einer Gefängnisstrafe verurteilt wurde, versuchte die Regierung den Mann wieder auf freien Fuß zu bekommen. Mützenich reiste in den Iran und besuchte den Rheinland-Pfälzer im Gefängnis und verhandelte mit den lokalen Regierungs- und Behördenvertretern. Das Gefängnis habe einen furchtbaren Eindruck gemacht und nebenan wurden auch politische Häftlinge gehalten, die wohl auch gefoltert wurden. Zuerst wollten die Iraner, dass man im Gegenzug zur Freilassung einen in Deutschland gefangenen Iraner freilassen sollte. Doch dieser war nicht nur wegen eines Anschlags auf ein Berliner Restaurant verurteilt sondern auch auf Grund von Rechtsstaatlichkeitsprinzipien war die Freilassung des Iraners keine Option. Nachher fand man einen gangbaren Weg, der zur Freilassung führte. Ob die Freilassung des iranischen Attentäters doch womöglich Teil der Verhandlung war ist mir persönlich unklar. Die ganze Story gibt’s auch hier.Mützenich ist keineswegs der aalglatte Politiker ohne kontroverse Meinungen, so gehörte er einer Minderheit in der SPD an, die die Lieferung der U-Boote an Israel kritisch sahen, insbesondere, da sie atomar bestückt werden können. Auch sonst hält Mützenich atomare Abschreckung als Waffensystem für “Blödsinn”. Und dennoch wurde er zum aussenpolitischen Sprecher und nun zum stellvertretenden Fraktionsvorsitzenden gewählt.Auch ein schöner Rücken kann entzücken - Leider konnte ich kein besseres Bild machen",

        "title": "Der Nahostkonflikt - Gespräch mit dem Referenten für Nahost",
        "author": "",
        "category": "politics",
        "content": "Das Gespräch im Außenministerium mit dem Referenten für die Nahostländer (daher fällt der Nahostkonflikt auch in seinen Zuständigkeitsbereich) war nicht nur in Bezug auf den Konflikt höchst aufschlussreich, sondern auch mit Blick auf das Berufsbild des Diplomaten im Auswärtigen Amt sehr interessant. Der Referent selbst war ein Jurist, der über das reguläre Bewerbungsverfahren für den höheren Dienst des Auswärtigen Amts zu der Stelle gekommen war. Vor der jetzigen Tätigkeit war er Koordinator zwischen der Bundesregierung und der NATO im Kosovo. Demnächst wird er in das Kanzleramt wechseln, dass auch eine eigenes Referat für Außenpolitik besitzt, welches allerdings ausschließlich durch Mitarbeiter des Auswärtigen Amtes besetzt wird.Die aktuelle Verhandlungsrunde ist nach Sicht der Dinge des Referenten in der kritischen Phase. Juli letzten Jahres brachte US-Außenminister Kerry beide Parteien an einen Tisch. Nun liegt alles auf dem Tisch. Oft klingt es so, als ob Deutsche beziehungsweise Europäer keine Rolle spielen: Dies ist jedoch nicht ganz richtig. So kann etwa die EU Anreize, wie die Teilnahme an Programmen als Drittländer, anbieten. So ist Israel schon heute Teilnehmerland eines Programmes, dass den Wegfall von Zöllen ermöglicht.Auch gibt der Referent unumwunden zu, dass bedingt durch die eigene Geschichte die Äquidistanz zwischen israelischer und palästinensischer Seite fehle. So ist es selbstverständlich, dass es niemals der deutsche Außenminister ist, der als erstes zu Gesprächen mit den Palästinensern fährt. Dort lasse man immer erst anderen Ländern den Vortritt. Dennoch werden Meinungsverschiedenheiten mit Israel offen angesprochen. Die Bundesregierung und der Bundesaußenminister äußern sich beispielsweise offen zu der ablehnenden Haltung zum Siedlungsbau, da dieser völkerrechtswidrig ist. So sind die Siedlungsgebiete von der deutschen Regierung offiziell nicht anerkannt.Mittlerweile gibt es über eine Millionen Flüchtlinge (Palästinensische), da der Flüchtlingsstatus an die nächste Generation weitergegeben wird. Mit dem Andauern des Konflikts steigt diese Zahl immer weiter an, was eine Rückkehr und andere Lösungen zunehmend erschwert. Ebenfalls als Hemmnis für eine Lösung des Nahostkonflikts kommt hinzu, dass Israel eine militärische Präsenz auf der Jordanbank beibehalten will, da diese nicht nur fruchtbar, sondern auch sicherheitsrelevant ist. Die Vorstellung, dass israelische Soldaten sich auf einem palästinensischen Staatsgebiet befinden werden sei indes für die Palästinenser eine unerträgliche Vorstellung. Noch problematischer werden die Siedlungsgebiete gesehen. Diese müssten bei einer Zwei-Staaten-Lösung weg, oder die Siedler bleiben, wie bei der belgisch-flämischen Lösung. Über diese Fragen wird auch im Deutsch-Palästinensischen-Lenkungsausschuss in der kommenden Woche gesprochen werden. Aufgrund der fehlenden Anerkennung eine palästinensischen Staates gibt es keine Regierungskonsultationen sondern stattdessen eben jenen Lenkungsausschuss.Auch die besondere Situation des Gaza-Streifens muss mit in den Blick genommen werden. Der Gaza ist abgekappt. Von den ehemals 1000 Tunneln, die nach Ägypten führten, sind etwa 90 Prozent geschlossen worden. Dies trägt unter Anderem zu der in toto desaströsen Lage bei: Die Jugendarbeitslosigkeit liegt bei circa 20 Prozent und es gibt regelmäßige Stromausfälle. Es gibt kaum Export und es darf auch nur sehr wenig in den Gaza-Streifen importiert werden. So lässt Israel zum Beispiel die Lieferung von Rohstoffen für den Bau von Schulen die Grenze passieren. Dieser Schulbau wird zum Teil auch von der deutschen KFW finanziert.Auch in anderen Fällen engagiert sich der deutsche Staat für die Palästinenser, Deutschland ist einer der Hauptfinanzierer der PLO. Ein weiteres Beispiel sind die vom Auswärtigen Amt finanzierten Solar-Panele südlich von Hebron im Westjordanland. Dort gab es eine “demolition order” der iraelischen Behörden, doch durch politisches Handeln des Auswärtigen Amts konnte ein Abriss verhindert werden. Grund für die “demolition orders” waren fehlende Baugenehmigungen, doch durch Gesprächen mit den Behörden konnte man sich einig werden und hat die Bauanträge im Nachhinein gestellt. Der Referent betont, wie oft man Probleme durch einfaches sprechen mit den zuständigen Stellen beheben kann. “Die lassen mit sich reden”Das Auswärtige Amt geht in Vier-Augen-Gesprächen seht offen mit Kritik um. Aber man vermeide es doch in Presseerklärungen Israelbashing zu betrteiben teilt der Referent freimütig mit. Hier sei man zurückhaltender als andere Länder. Man redet den Israelis zwar keineswegs nach dem Mund und verfolgt auch seine eigene Agenda, nämlich die Zwei-Staaten-Lösung, bleibt aber vorsichtiger.Am Schluss kommt noch zur Sprache, dass die Hamas nachts Truppen durch den Gaza-Streifen schickt, um zu verhindern, dass Raketen abgeschossen werden und der Waffenstillstand gebrochen wird. Nach diesem Schlussfakt ist noch Zeit den Referenten zu seinem Beruf zu befragen. Er gibt bereitwillig Auskunft darüber, dass die Arbeit ihm nach wie vor Spaß mache und er seine Entscheidung sich zu bewerben nie bereut hat. Es macht Spaß sich immer wieder in neue Themenbereiche einzuarbeiten. Auch das Rotationssystem sieht er positiv. Diesbezüglich ist er jedoch auf größere Außenposten beschränkt, da seine Frau auch im Auswärtigen Amt arbeitet und beide immer gemeinsam zur selben Einsatzstelle wechseln. Die Bewerbung sollte man gelassen angehen, am Ende ist immer ein Quäntchen Glück dabei, da es immer von der Auswahlkommission abhängt, was im jeweiligen Jahrgang grade gesucht wird. Zur Zeit werden viele Kollegen mit Chinesischkenntnissen eingestellt, da das Auswärtige Amt auf eine Präsenz von einer ausreichend diversen Sprachkompetenz achtet.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "politics",
        "content": "Im Rahmen des SPD-Praktikantenprogrammes nehme ich am Themenmodul Nahostkonflikt teil, dies ist für sich genommen schon ein interessantes Thema. Allerdings ist die Tatsache, dass ich diesen Monat für zwei Wochen nach Israel reise, ein nicht unerheblicher Motivationsfaktor.Den Beginn stellt die Einführung durch die Wissenschaftlerin Muriel Asseburg dar, die Leiterin der Nahostabteilung der Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik ist, welche eine von der Bundesregierung gegründete Stiftung ist, die jedoch unabhängig ist. Sie ist ein Pendant des Wissenschaftlichen Dienstes im Bundestag. Dort kann arbeiten, wer eine Promotion und Sprachkenntnisse der Länder auf die er sich spezialisiert hat. Zudem besteht die Möglichkeit dort Praktika in verschiedenen Themenbereichen zu absolvieren.Die zunächst wesentlichen Punkte, über die Frau Asseburg referiert sind im folgenden aufgeführt. Zur Zeit läuft eine von US-Präsident Obama angestossene, neue Verhandlungsrunde. Deren Ergebnisse sollen bis Ende Mai vorliegen.Im wesentlichen geht es um fünf echte Endstatusthemen:JerusalemGrenzenSiedlungenFlüchtlingeSicherheitsarrangementJerusalemDie Palästinenser beanspruchen Ost-Jerusalem für sich, was die Israelis allerdings als Konzession nicht zu machen bereit sind. Sie wollen ganz Jerusalem behalten.Ein Vorschlag, der auf dem Tisch ist, ist, dass Teile in denen Israelis leben zu Israel und wiederum Teile in denen Palästinenser leben zu Palästina gehören sollen.Die Lage wird durch den Siedlungsbau der Israelis verkompliziert: Es gibt immer weniger zusammenhängende palästinensischen Gebiete, die für eine Staatenbildung notwendig wären.GrenzenAngezielt sind die Linien von 1948, also die Grenzen vor dem Krieg 1967.FlüchtlingeDie Flüchtlinge des ersten arabisch-israelischen Krieges 1948 und deren Abkömmlinge sind Gegenstand dieses Punktes. Nach UN-Recht steht ihnen einen Entschädigung zu. Auch steht ihnen das Recht auf Rückkehr zu, oder der Verbleib in einem Drittstaat bzw. im Staat in dem sie sich jetzt aufhalten. Israel ist jedoch zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt nicht bereit eine Rückkehr zum Gegenstand eines Friedensvertrages zu machen.SicherheitsarrangementVon israelischer Seite wird gefordert, dass ein palästinensischer Staat keine schweren Waffen und keine Bündnisfähigkeit in den ersten Jahren erhalten darf. Zudem will Israel eine Militärpräsenz im Jordangraben. Dies ist für die Palästinenser ein neuralgischer Punkt, da die Grenze zu Jordanien damit unter israelischer Kontrolle stände, was hieße, dass die Palästinenser keine souveräne Kontrolle über Grenzverkehr und grenzüberschreitenden Handel hätten.Zudem kamen noch einige weitere Punkte zur Sprache:WasserIsrael bezieht zur Zeit große Teile seines Wassers aus palästinensischen Wasservorkommen. Die Frage, was mit diesen nach einer Gründung eines palästinensischen Staates geschieht ist ein ebenfalls kritischer Punkt.Anerkennung des jüdischen StaatesDie palästinensische Seite will dies nicht. Eine Angst, dass die Formulierung eines jüdischen Staates als Vorwand dienen könnte, um eine Rückkehr von Flüchtlingen zu verweigern.Eine nicht überfüllte Veranstaltung mit einigem an Dokumenten zur Nacharbeit&hellip;Im Anschluss ging Frau Asseburg noch einmal auf die aktuellen Bemühungen der Amerikaner ein. Diese versuchen aktuell ein sogenanntes Rahmenabkommen zu erreichen. Damit ist ein vorläufiger Vertrag gemeint in dem Prinzipien, an denen sich die Verhandlung orientieren soll, festgehalten sind. Grundsätzlich gilt, dass für beide Seiten kein Abkommen schlechter ist, als ein schlechtes Abkommen. Erschwerend kommt auf israelischer Seite hinzu, dass Netanjahu in der Knesset viele Siedlervertreter im Nacken sitzen, genau so in seiner eigenen Partei.Die darauffolgende offene Fragerunde rückte noch einmals einzelne Aspekte stärker in den Fokus, um sie genauer zu beleuchten. So hält Frau Asseburg es für wahrscheinlicher, dass ein Scheitern der Verhandlungen auf palästinensischer Seite zu einer Internationalisierung führt, als dass es zu einem blutigen Konflikt, einer dritten Intifada kommt. Mit Internationalisierung ist ein Zuwenden an die internationale Gemeinschaft gemeint, etwa ein Beschreiten des Rechtswegs über den Internationalen Strafgerichtshof oder eine Anerkennung Palästinas durch die UN. Palästina hat in der arabischen Welt noch viele Verbündete, auch wenn davon ein Großteil in der Gegenwart weniger aktiv Druck ausüben und für eine Lösung des Konflikts kämpfen, wie etwa in den Siebzigern mit dem Ölembargo. Ägypten hat beispielsweise die Tunnel zum Gaza-Streifen geschlossen und verursacht somit eine Geldverknappung bei der Hamas, die durch eine Besteuerung des Warenverkehrs durch die Tunnel die Gehälter ihrer Bediensteten finanziert.Auch der Siedlungsbau wurde thematisiert. Die Gründe, weshalb Israel bzw. die israelische Regierung den Siedlungsbau vorantreibt lassen sich nicht auf einen Kern eindampfen. Vielmehr gibt es verschieden Gründe, die in Betracht kommen. Eine Möglichkeit, die Frau Asseburg jedoch für unwahrscheinlich hält, ist die, dass die politischen Akteure eine Großisrael-Ideologie verfolgen und umzusetzen versuchen. Ebenfalls kommt in Betracht, dass der Siedlungsbau ein Instrument Netanjahus ist, um in den eigenen Reihen Zugeständnisse an die palästinensische Seite zu verkaufen. So korrelieren Siedlungsbau und die Freilassung von palästinensischen Häftlingen in israelischen Gefängnissen zeitlich. Die Theorie, dass der Siedlungsbau ein Angebot an die Hardliner in den eigenen Reihen ist, wird unterstützt durch die bestehende Möglichkeit, dass der Siedlungsbau letztendlich ein reversibler Prozess ist.Zuletzt wurde noch ein Schlaglicht auf den Grund dafür geworfen, dass es keinen palästinensischen Staat, sehr wohl aber einen israelischen gibt. Nach dem ersten israelisch-arabischen Krieg 1948 wurde von der UN eine Teilungserklärung in einer Resolution angeboten, welche die Israelis anerkannt haben. Die Palästinenser hingegen haben eine Anerkennung kategorisch ausgeschlossen, da sie das gesamte Palästina beanspruchten. Heute verweigern in der UN viele europäische und westliche Staaten - auch Deutschland - eine Anerkennung eines palästinensischen Staates. Als Grund wird dabei auf die Definition eines Staates nach UN-Recht verwiesen, die vorsieht, dass es ein Staatsgebiet, eine Bevölkerung und eine das Gebiet durchdringende Regierungsstruktur geben muss. Diese Anforderungen sind zur Zeit noch nicht erfüllt.",

        "content": "Der heutige Dienstag (auch wenn ich das hier eigentlich retrospektiv schreibe, erwecke ich nichtsdestotrotz mal den Eindruck, alles wäre unmittelbar - wirkt halt spannender! Es ist nur ein klein wenig fake…) war der ereignisreichste - weil vielseitigste Tag - bisher. Er begann damit, dass ich leicht unausgeschlafen ins Paul-Löbe-Haus eile und den vermeintlich existenten Eingang zur Spreeseite nicht finde und einmal um den ganzen Gebäudekomplex sprinten darf.Der TagesablaufLos ging es damit, dass die Sitzung der SPD-Arbeitsgruppe für Arbeit und Soziales stattfand. Ich durfte mit Axel und Henriette, den beiden wissenschaftlichen Mitarbeitern, dem Geschehen beiwohnen. Die Themen waren breit gefächert und hauptsächlich ging es darum die morgige Ausschusssitzung vorzubereiten. Hierzu war die sozialdemokratische parlamentarischen Staatssekretärin vom BMAS anwesend (Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales. Die Abgeordneten lieben Abkürzungen und bei den Ministerialbeamten schrammt es haarscharf an der Grenze zum krankhaften Fetisch vorbei!). Hauptsächlich ging es darum offene Fragen zu klären und das morgige Verhalten abzustimmen. Die anscheinend übernächtigte Staatssekretärin Anette Kramme war zu Gegen, um die Fragen der Ausschussmitglieder zu beantworten. Der volle Terminkalender von Herrn Kapschack ist ja schon beeindruckend, Frau Kramme und andere parlamentarische Staatssekretäre dürften hingegen ein noch weitreichenderes Arbeitspensum haben. Dort scheinen Überstunden mehr die Regel als die Ausnahme zu sein. Dies scheint der Preis zu sein, der mit einer hervorgehobenen Position einhergeht.Anette Kramme, leider auf dem unscharfen Foto weiter unten nicht zu erkennen, deshalb hier das Pressefoto vom BMASAuch interessant ist, wie in der Arbeitsgruppe die Landesstrukturen der SPD abgebildet werden. Und zwar entsendet jedes SPD-geführte Land einen Berichterstatter oder eine Berichterstatterin, die den AG-Sitzungen beiwohnt. So setzt sich die AG aus ca. 10 Abgeordneten und ca. 15 Landesvertretern zusammen. Zudem sind noch ca. 30 Mitarbeiter mit von der Partie.Die Abgeordneten stellen Fragen, wie “Wie verhalte ich mich jetzt zu Thema xy?”. Beeindruckend war noch der für die “Mütterrente” verantwortliche Referatsleiter aus dem BMAS, der auch für Fragen zur Verfügung stand. Gewissermaßen einer der Spitzenbeamten Deutschlands, der den Laden Bundesrepublik Deutschland am laufen hält. Er wusste auf fast jede Frage eine wasserdichte Antwort und wirkte bescheiden, was bei seinem Wissensvorsprung und Strotzen vor Kompetenz sicherlich keine Selbstverständlichkeit ist. Hier ein kleiner Auszug aus den Themen, um die inhaltlichen Sphären einmal konkret zu illustrieren:Öffentlichkeitsarbeit koste 1 Mio €Probleme mit TVGG (Tarifvergabegesetz in NRW)Bundesdruckerei als Klägerin vor EuGhEinschätzung des Hauses &ldquo;Erhebliche Probleme&rdquo;Stellungnahme der Bundesregierung erfordert Konsens der MinisterienFinanzministerium dagegen, weil Bundesdruckerei dort angesiedeltEinzige Option: Entweder negativ beantworten oder einer Bewertung enthaltenMütterrenteExperte aus Arbeitsministerium erklärt &ldquo;Mütterrente&rdquo; und klärt Fragen der Abgeordneten aufDeutsche Rentenversicherung kann bei Bestandsrenten Beitragsbemessungsgrenze nicht anwenden, weil es IT-technisch nicht umzusetzen ist =&gt; Pauschalierung: Ein Rentenpunkt “on top” für alle Bestandsrentner, die unter die Neuregelung fallenGrund: Bemessungsgrenzen sind für jeweiliges Jahr anders als heuteUngerechtigkeit/Ungleichheit, die sachlich gerechtfertigt istVerwaltungstechnische Massenabfertigung9 Mio. Akten müssten angeschaut werden =&gt; Daher ist Pauschalierung sinnvollDann erwähnt die Ausschussvorsitzende Katja Mast noch, dass morgen zur Ausschusssitzung ein Kamerateam von “Panorama” (ARD-Investigativmagazin) anwesend sein wird. “Panorama ist immer fies”, wie es flapsig zu hören ist. “Aber es würde komisch aussehen, wenn keiner was sagt, am Besten einer von uns sagt was.”. Was noch auffällt ist, dass die Abgeordneten sich in ihren Redebeiträgen oft auf ihren Wahlkreis beziehen - in meinem Wahlkreis ist xy Thema, ich bekomme viele Anfragen zum Thema xy -. Man könnte sagen, die Einbindung der Bürger scheint halbwegs zu funktionieren. Natürlich ist die willkürliche Zusammensetzung der Abgeordneten für diesen Themenbereich problematisch. So erreichen Entwicklungen in den Restlichen x-hundert Wahlkreisen die Abgeordneten, die die Gesetzgebung im Bereich Arbeit und Soziales überwachen und anregen nicht unmittelbar. Überhaupt wird deutlich, dass die Kompetenz im Ministerium liegt. Die Abgeordneten selbst wären wahrscheinlich gar nicht in der Lage, einen sinnvollen Gesetzesentwurf zu entwickeln. Dies kann man bedenklich finden oder nicht, jedenfalls ist es so.Die Mitarbeiter und Praktikanten sind die, die ohne jegliche Körperspannung auf den Stühlen hinter den Abgeordneten herumlungernNach der Sitzung hat Ralf noch ein Treffen mit der Berichterstatterin für Arbeit und Soziales der NRW-Landesvertretung auf der Tagesordnung. Also gehen wir mit ihr ins “Käfer”, dem Selbstbedienungs-Restaurant im Reichstag. Das Essen kostet leider 6€, solide Hausmannskost, die schmeckt, aber keine Begeisterungsstürme entfacht. Hier speisen auch schonmal die Minister und andere Politikschwergewichte, wie ich hier einmal ganz boulevardesk anfügen möchte. Nachdem ich erfahre, dass es in der NRW-Landesvertretung in Berlin vorzügliche Übernachtungsmöglichkeiten und lukullische Buffets geben soll, geht es wieder durch die unterirdischen Gänge zum Büro. Das ist ungefähr die Aussicht die man auf dem Weg vom Jakob-Kaiser-Haus zum Reichstag (Orange) und dann zum Paul-Löbe-Haus hatAuf dem Weg weißt mich Henriette darauf hin, dass grade Renate Künast und Jürgen Tritten an mir vorbeigegangen sind. “Die gibt es ja tatsächlich alle wirklich!”, denke ich mir.Essen  - fuck yeah!Im alten Gebäude rechts ist der Sitz der parlamentarischen GesellschaftIm Anschluss an die Erledigung einiger Büroarbeiten darf ich mit zum parlamentarischen Mittagstisch der Parlamentarischen Linken, der Ralf angehört. Auf dem Weg zur parlamentarischen Gesellschaft, laufen wir an Sarah Wagenknecht vorbei, die vis-a-vis genau so aussieht wie im Fernsehen und grade einen Fototermin wahrnimmt. Eine beistehende Person meint dazu “Die sehen nur alle in echt viel kleiner aus, als im Fernsehen. Ursula von der Leyen geht mir bis hier (Er deutet mit seiner Handkante auf sein Kinn)”. Die parlamentarische Gesellschaft ist im ehemaligen Gebäude des Reichtagspräsidenten untergebracht und schon der Portier mit seinem extravaganten Schnurrbart macht klar, hier herrscht gediegene, englische Clubatosphäre. Hier steht nun eine Einladung der Umweltministerin Barbara Hendricks an. Diese kam dann, wie es bei den vielbeschäftigten Ministern Usus ist, auch nach einer - fast nicht mehr - kurzen Weile und referierte über ihre Pläne, Ziele und Probleme innerhalb der Koalition. Besonders brisantes Thema ist aktuell die Zulassung eines Genmaises auf EU-Ebene. “Wir kriegen immer Anträge von Grünen und Linke, die im Zweifelsfall uns vorführen und CDU/CSU nicht in Verlegenheit bringen”, ist hier und da zu hören. Konkret geht es darum, dass in der Koalition Uneinigkeit bei diese Thematik herrscht. Weil nicht alle “Häuser” (Ministerien) sich auf eine gemeinsame Position verständigen konnten, fehlt es der Regierung an Sprechfähigkeit beim Genmais. Konsequenz ist, dass Deutschland sich im Europäischen Rat bei der Abstimmung über die Zulassung des Genmaises enthalten wird und somit die Zulassung nicht verhindert wird, wie es sich die SPD- und CSU-geführten Häuser wünschen, wie es auch schon bei SPON zu lesen ist.Mehr schlecht als recht zu erkennen: Das fast schon livrierte Personal und Barbara Hendricks in grau vorm FensterMitschrift einfügenAls alles gesagt ist und die Veranstaltung zu Ende ist, warte ich vor der Tür auf Ralf, und bekomme schon fast einen leichten Schock, als plötzlich Barbara Hendricks vor mir steht. Mit der Zeit gewöhnt man sich daran, andauernd von Leuten umgeben zu sein, die man sich nie als reale, nahbare Menschen hat vorstellen können. Jedenfalls muss Ralf zur Fraktionssitzung und ich ins Büro. Weil Fraktionssitzungen aller Parteien zur selben Zeit stattfindet, bin ich an den Aufzügen im Reichstag wieder einmal mehr “starstruck”, Karl Lauterbach, Johanna Wanka etc. auf einem Fleck. Anschließend laufe ich - wohl, weil immer noch irritiert, leicht verstörend dreinschauend - Katrin Göring Eckardt fast über den Haufen. Dann, um diese Erfahrung reicher, geht es wieder ins Büro, wo ich erst einmal ein Protokoll schreiben darf. Nach getaner Arbeit geht es auch gleich weiter: Eine Führung durch das Kanzleramt steht auf dem Programm.Alles fängt damit an, dass alle durch eine Sicherheitsschleuse müssen, dass heißt: Metalldetektor und Gepäckdurchleuchtung. Danach werden wir vom Wachhäuschen in einen Durchgang geleitet und befinden uns tatsächlich hinter dem Gitter des Kanzleramtes vor dem imposanten Eingang für Staatsgäste, durch den wir dann auch das Kanzleramt betreten. Die Ehrfurcht gebietende Architektur mit ihrer minimalistischen Reduktion auf Licht und Raum macht schon ganz schön Eindruck. Das sieht also eine ausländische Delegation, bevor Merkel sie unter den Tisch verhandelt. Die türkis-weiße Farbgebung wirkt zwar nicht wirklich, wie aus der Zeit gefallen, dennoch ist sie etwas kühl und nicht umbedingt behaglich. Bei der Führung durch den leutseligen Besucherbetreuer erfährt man allerhand Anekdoten aus dem Alltag der Kanzlerin, dass sie etwa nur zum Telefonieren am Kanzlerschreibtisch sitzt und ansonsten am langen Schreibtisch Platz nimmt, weil sie so direkten Kontakt zu ihrem Vorzimmer halten kann. Nach weiteren heiter-humoristischen Anekdoten und einschläfernden Fakten dürfen wir schließlich ins Herz des Hauses: dem Kabinett! Es ist fast schon irreal, dass man - trotz aller Terrorpanik - so nah an diesen wichtigen Ort darf. Eine erwähnenswerte Information ist, die Tatsache, dass man die Handschrift einer bildmediengeprägten Welt auch hier wiederfindet. So sind doch tatsächlich starke Scheinwerfer in der Decke eingelassen, die vor jeder Kabinettssitzung aktiviert werden, damit die Journalisten (Bewegt-)Bilder machen können. Das sind dann die Videoschnipsel ohne Ton, die man in der Regel in den Abendnachrichten zu sehen bekommt.Das schwarze Objekt ist der herunterfahrbare Scheinwerfer von dem es sicher gut 15 Stück im Kabinett gibtWährend der Kabinettssitzung herrscht allerdings ein strenges Anwesenheitsverbot. Im Gegensatz zu allen anderen Konferenzräumen, gibt es hier auch keine Mikrofone, da die Besprechungen hier vertraulich sind. Es gibt zwar ein Protokoll, was erst nach 50 Jahren publik wird, jedoch handelt es sich dabei nur um ein Ergebnisprotokoll und nicht um eine Wortprotokoll. Ein weiteres womöglich erwähnenswertes Faktum, ist die Tatsache, dass die Kanzlerin eigene Vertrauensdolmetscher hat, auf die sie für vertrauliche Gespräche immer zurückgreift. Die dürften einiges an pikanten Details zu erzählen haben. Die Vorstellung, wie so jemand die Zeitung aufschlägt, liest, was die Journalisten über einen Staatsbesuch meinen, und denkt: Alles falsch. Es war ganz anders!, ist eine irgendwie amüsante Vorstellung. Diese Dolmetscher haben in 5 Jahren sicher auf Parties in der Küche die coolsten Anekdoten zu erzählen. Die Führung endet mit einer Begehung der netten Kanzleramtsterasse.Böse Zungen behaupten: Sowohl Kanzlerin als auch Kanzleramt fehle es an SexappealKreuzfahrtfeeling auf der ToiletteEin auf peinlichste Weise euphorischer PraktikantMittig: Großer Konferenzsaal; Rechts: Mürrische FrauDer von innen extrem hässlige Aufzug!Die großzügig dimensionierte TerassentürAusblick und so #swag #yoloUnter den unzähligen Praktikanten-Facebook-Gruppen existiert unter anderem eine, welche alle Praktikanten fraktionsübergreifend vereinigt. Dort wird auch jeden Mittwoch ein Praktikantenstammtisch organisiert. Nach der Führung finde ich noch zwei Mitstreiter, die ebenfalls zum Stammtisch wollen. Also fahren wir frohen Mutes zur Oranienburger und nach einem Abstecher zu meiner persönlichen kulinarischen Neuentdeckung des Monats - einer indischen Teigtasche mit Hühnchen-, gehen wir auch schon in die Kneipe Oranium. Dort sitzen auch schon knapp ein Dutzend Praktikanten und tatsächlich: Die hemdtragenden mit Sakko und Gelfrisur sind auch tatsächlich bei der CDU. Zudem macht eine Praktikum in der Zeitschrift “Das Parlament” und eine weitere in der Verwaltung des Bundestages. Am lustigsten ist der Praktikant von Peter Altmaier, der aus dem Nähkästchen plaudert. Dafurch erfahren wir, dass der Kanzleramtsminister gerne auch mal morgens am Flughafen, Mittags und Abends zu McDonalds fährt. Auch sonst kocht Peter Altmaier für sein Leben gern. Am Ende werde ich noch in die exklusive WhatsApp Gruppe der Praktikanten aufgenommen in der man sich zum Mittagessen und Unternehmungen verabredet. Der vielsagende Gruppenname “Chabos und Babos” ist dem Wahlplakat von Jan Giersdorf dediziert.Wie ein Kommentator folgerichtig äusserte: &ldquo;Hoffentlich klaut ihm im Stadtrat keiner die Lunchbox&rdquo;",

        "content": "Heute stand eine Führung durch das Willy-Brandt-Haus, der SPD-Parteizentrale, auf dem Programm. Neben der Standard-Besucherführung beginnt das Ganze erst einmal mit einem Gespräch mit der Referentin für Direktkommunikation. In ihrer Abteilung beantwortet sie unter anderem die Anfragen und Nachrichten an den Parteivorstand. Die Referentin redet sehr schnell und enthusiastisch, man merkt ihr an, dass sie Feuer und Flamme für die Partei ist. Sie wählt einen naheliegenden, persönlichen Gesprächseinstieg: Ihre Geschichte, wie sie zur SPD kam. Sie wuchs in einem kleinen Dorf auf und konnte sich nur vorstellen zu den Jungen Grünen oder den Jusos zu gehen. Letztendlich entschied der profane Umstand, dass es in ihrem Dorf nur einen Juso-Verband gab, über ihre Parteizugehörigkeit. Heute sei sie froh, dass sie nicht zu den Grünen gekommen ist: “Die achten zwar auf Umweltschutz, vergessen aber die finanziell Schwachen in der Gesellschaft”. Diese Behauptung scheint eher wie eine Schutzbehauptung, dennoch ist klar, dass “Was wäre wenn”-Fragen nach mehren Jahrzehnten natürlich müßig sind und keinen Erkenntnisgewinn bringen. Stattdessen sollte man akzeptieren, dass - grade am Anfang - fraglos auch Zufall und Willkür eine Rolle spielen.Funfact: Es gab eine tolle Saftauswahl, allein deshalb sollte jeder diese Führung machen!Besonders in Erinnerung blieben die zwei folgenden Anekdoten:Zum einen berichtet die Referentin von den unschönen Seiten ihres Jobs, wenn sie auf rassistische, fremdenfeindliche oder schlicht dumme Schreiben reagieren muss. Oft nimmt die Absurdität groteske Züge an, so erzählt die Referentin: “Meine Lieblings-Veschwörungstheorie ist ja, dass Yasmin Fahimi Muslima sei und die Partei unterwandern wolle. Diese Warnungen erhalten wir ab und zu aus den Ortsverbänden.”.Auch aus dem Bundestagswahlkampf 2013 weiß die Referentin interessantes zu berichten. Es war nämlich so, dass Steinbrück sehr viele externe Mitarbeiter für Wahlkampfleitung mitbrachte. Weil Steinbrück in der vorherigen Legislaturperiode nur einfacher Abgeordneter war, ist er nicht mehr so gut im Willy-Brandt-Haus vernetzt gewesen. Deshalb brachte er also viel Personal von ausserhalb mit und setzte einigen Referatsleitern sein Personal mit der Ansage “Du gibst mal alles was du zu diesem Thema hast an xy” vor die Nase. Die sich ergebenden Verwerfungen und der Zuständigkeits-Wirrwarr hätten im Willy-Brand-Haus die Stimmung gedrückt. So gab es auch Probleme in Direktkommunikation, weil unklar war, wer von dem Wahlkampfteam nun wofür zuständig war.Ich stelle die Frage, wie den die Parteizentrale mit der Bundestagsfraktion vernetzt sei und bekomme daraufhin zu hören “Das ist eine sehr gute Frage!”. Die Antwort fällt leider weniger gut aus, sodass mir der Zusammenhang noch immer nicht wirklich klar ist. “Es ist ziemlich kompliziert” ist alles was ich aus der Antwort sicher festhalten kann. Ansonsten wird deutlich, dass Partei und Fraktion prinzipiell zwei relativ unabhängige Strukturen sind. Wie sie im genauen vernetzt sind, bleibt leider unklar.Als es um die Parteizugehörigkeit der Mitarbeiter im Willy-Brandthaus geht, wird die Referentin noch eine Nuance engagierter als ohnehin schon: “Ich finde, dass man sich zur Partei bekennen sollte! Wenn man hier arbeitet kann man nicht nach Hause gehen und sagen: Ich tue nur meinen Job, das was hier politisch geschieht, geht mich nichts an.”. Dass man sich diesbezüglich nicht in die Tasche lügen sollte, ist klar, dennoch gleicht ihr Enthusiasmus für die Partei dem der Amerikaner für Amerika. Beides stößt bei mir erst einmal auf ähnliches Befremden. Vermutlich ist es ganz normal, wenn man mehrere Dekaden in einer Partei Mitglied ist und sich in großen Teilen mit ihr identifiziert. Die Referentin ist der Gegenentwurf zu manchen Politikern, die ihr Verhältnis zur Partei ganz kühl als ein rationales Zweckbündnis bezeichnen, dass aufgrund der großen inhaltlichen Schnittmenge eingegangen wird. Dies scheint meiner Meinung nach der im Zweifelsfall gesündere Blick auf die Dinge zu sein. Wenn man eine allzu starke emotionale Bindung mit einer Partei eingeht und die Partei am Ende des Tages so identitätsstiftend ist, dass man sich selbst persönlich angegriffen sieht, wenn jemand die Partei - und nicht einen selbst - kritisiert, wird es gefährlich.Die Führung durch die Parteizentrale im Anschluss ist mehr oder minder kurzweilig. Die dafür abgestellte studentische Aushilfskraft war Praktikant bei Thomas Demaiziere “und hat die Kurve zum Glück noch rechtzeitig bekommen”, wie die Referentin bemerkt. Jene Aushilfskraft referiert nun also allerhand über die Architektur, von der ressourcenschonenden Regenwasserpeicherung bis hin zum peinlichen Faktum, dass unter der Treppe im Foyer der Grundstein des Willy-Brandt-Hauses mitsamt eines Handabdruckes des damaligen Parteivorsitzenden Oskar Lafontaine zu finden ist. Auch von einer kuriosen Paketsendung zum Ende der Koalitionsverhandlungen 2013 weiß der Student zu berichten. Ihm wurde ein Paket auf den Schreibtisch geliefert, welches mehrere Einmachgläser mit einer undefinierbaren schleimigen Flüssigkeit enthielt. Dem beigelegten Zettel war zu entnehmen, dass sich die Flüssigkeit aus Öl, Gewürzen und Seiten des Koalitionsvertrages zusammensetzte. Mit dieser &ldquo;Großen Konsenssoße&rdquo; wollte ein SPD-Basismitglied, das wohl Künstler war, seinen Unmut über die Große Koalition zum Ausdruck bringen. Unser Führer plaudert noch aus, dass er normalerweise vor allem ältere Semester durch die Parteizentrale führt, was beim Mitgliedsalter von durchschnittlichen 60 Jahren auch nicht weiter verwundert.Nach der Führung gehe ich zum Taylor-Swift-Konzert in der O2-Arena, aber das ist eine gänzlich andere Geschichte&hellip;Weniger hübsch als der Besucherausweis im Bundestag, aber immerhin etwas.Die Europawahlkampfzentrale - viel scheint nicht los zu sein.So sieht ein echter SPD-Referent aus!",

        "content": "Die Möglichkeiten sich einzubringen stehen jedem und jeder offen, nur nutzt eben nur eine verschwindend geringe Menge die offenen Möglichkeiten. Solange prinzipiell jeder kann, wenn er denn nur will, stellt es auch noch kein allzu großes Problem dar. Wenn jedoch zahlreiche Lobbyisten, die einfache Zugänglichkeit nutzen und der Durchschnittsbürger nicht, dann ergibt sich eine Imbalance. Der Abgeordnete muss dann erkennen, wenn Partikularinteressen zum Gemeinwohl und jegliche noch so kleine Veränderung des Status quo zum Untergang des Abendlands erklärt wird. Die geringe Bürgerbeteiligung ist also schon ein Kardinalproblem, auch wenn sie nicht aufgrund von autoritären Strukturen so gering ist.Bei ebendiesem Prozess, der sich im deutschen Bundestag vollzieht, geht es darum, entscheidende Weichenstellungen für die Zukunft eines ganzen Landes zu stellen. Es ist der Ort, an dem die wesentlichen Entscheidungen für unser Land getroffen werden, wie Andreas Voßkuhle es pointiert formulierte. Und einmal genauer hinzuschauen zu können, wie eine solch unvorstellbare Aufgabe auf der ganz konkreten - und eben nicht auf der abstrakten Ebene - angegangen wird, ist eine hochspannende, einmalige Chance.Was einem schon nach wenigen Tagen klar wird, ist, dass der Bundestag, das Parlament, die Regierung eine Art künstliche Intelligenz darstellen, die die Bedürfnisse, Verlangen und Wünsche einer ganzen Nation abzubilden vermag. Natürlich nicht perfekt - aber erstaunlich gut, wenn man sich die Größenverhältnisse in Erinnerung ruft. Wie macht die künstliche Intelligenz Parlament das nun? Soweit ich es verstehe - natürlich ist dies nur eine krude Annäherung an die Realität - bildet das Parlament Interessen und Entscheidungsspielräume und einschränkende Parameter durch Menschen ab.Nun, wie funktioniert das konkret? Zum Beispiel so: Die Koalition verabschiedet unter Bundesarbeitsministerin Andrea Nahles das “Rentenpaket”. Hier überschneiden sich nun die Interessen der künstlichen Intelligenz Regierung und der künstlichen Intelligenz SPD, die (positiven) Veränderungen den Bürgern mitzuteilen. Das Interesse über die negativen Folgen zu informieren übernimmt die Opposition. Man könnte sagen, dass die künstliche Intelligenz Bundesrepublik sich der künstlichen Intelligenz SPD bedient. Auf welcher Beschreibungsebene man nun die künstliche Intelligenz nun genau ansiedelt ist letztendlich nicht absolut zu sagen. Ist es noch der Ortsverband? (ja?) Und vielleicht der Verbund aus 4 Genossen darin, die für eine Abschaffung der Hatz4-Sanktionen eintreten? (nein?).Aber zurück zum konkreten Beispiel beim Rentenpaket: Nun schreibt Theresa Bücker eine Mail an alle SPD-MdBs, in der sie darauf hinweist, dass doch alle bei Twitter den Hashtag “#rentenpaket” benutzen sollten, wenn es darum geht. Weiter weist sie auf eine Infografik hin, die für die Einbindung in die Websites, der Facebookseiten etc. der MdBs gedacht ist. Nun warum tut Sie das? Die Antwort lässt sich bereits erahnen: Weil Theresa Bücker für die Koordinierung des Social-Media-Auftritts der SPD-Bundestagsfraktion verantwortlich ist. Sie ist Referentin für Social Media bei der Bundestagsfraktion der SPD. In diesem Moment wird das Interesse der Partei als ganzes - was diesen Themenkomplex anbelangt - ihr Interesse. Denn vertritt sie die Interessen der Partei zum Social-Media-Auftritt nicht, muss sie später damit rechnen, persönliche, negative Konsequenzen für ihr Ansehen und ihre weitere Karriere zu spüren zu bekommen. Schon die mögliche sozialer Sanktionierung durch Parteifreunde wirkt darauf hin, dass sie sich besonders engagiert, denn jeder in der Partei weiß, dass etwa eine misslungene Facebook-Kampagne in ihren Zuständigkeitsbereich fällt. Die Partei macht sich ihr gewissermaßen zu nutzen. So kann die künstliche Intelligenz SPD ihre abstrakten Ziele und Interessen auf und durch Theresa Bücker abbilden. Natürlich gilt diese Beziehung auch umgekehrt. Wenn Theresa Bückert gute Arbeit im Sinne der künstlichen Intelligenz SPD leistet, wird sie ganz persönlich davon profitieren. Genau so verhält es sich bei so ziemlich allen Belangen, die für die SPD von Wichtigkeit sind. Es gibt genaue Organigramme und eindeutige Zuständigkeiten. Jedes Element, jedes Büro, jede Person, die Teil davon ist, dient dazu die Parteiinteressen mit abzubilden. So kann trotz der begrenzten geistigen und zeitlichen Ressourcen des einzelnen Menschen eine Art Organismus erwachsen, der Entscheidungen für 80 Millionen Menschen mehr oder minder gut zu treffen vermag.Und aufgrund der Abstraktionsebenen (Ortsverband, Kreisverband, Landesverband, Bundesverband etc.) bleibt es am Ende auch für den einfachen Bürger, zwar mehr schlecht als recht, aber dennoch nachvollziehbar. Und wenn sich der Eindruck des Handelns der Bundesregierung von der Souveränität eines Talkshowauftritts von Sigmar Gabriel ableitet, ist dies immer noch besser als Garnichts. Politisches Engagement ist eine Bringschuld eines jeden Bürgers! Auch wenn er nicht aktiv werden muss, so sollte er es werden.Im Intranet der SPD-Fraktion gibt es auch noch ein ausführlicheres Organigramm mit Durchwahlen etc.*Kann natürlich auch alles falsch sein, vielleicht bin ich zu sehr durch die Lektüre von Erving Goffmans sehr lesenswertem &ldquo;Wir alle spielen Theater” auf die menschliche Interaktion fixiert.

        "content": "Wie war dein erster Tag im Bundestag? Lecker, so lautet die lakonische Antwort.Die etwas ausführlichere lautet hingegen, wie folgt:Es begann damit, dass ich mich, wie vereinbart gegen 10 Uhr zum Eingang 68a des Jakob-Kaiser Hauses begab - zumindest dachte ich das. Glücklicherweise sah man es mir nach, dass ich - wohl in der Aufregung des ersten Tages noch etwas derangiert - zielstrebig am richtigen Eingang vorbeigelaufen war. Die Pförtner ließen mich passieren und stellten mir einen vorläufigen Gästeausweis aus. In der eindrucksvollen Lobby durfte ich einige Minuten auf Axel, den wissenschaftlichen Mitarbeiter von Ralf Kapschack, warten. Während des Wartens konnte ich mich ein wenig wundern, wie einfach es doch ist, in das Gebäude zu kommen. Bei der Terrorpanik, die die hiesige Innen- und Verteidigungsminister zur Begründung unterschiedlichster Vorhaben heranziehen, fiel es einem durchaus auf, dass hier anscheinend ein doppelter Standard herrscht.Nach einer kursorischen Einführung durch Axel, bekam ich gleich meinen ersten Arbeitsauftrag: Einen Hausausweis für mich beantragen. Weil Monatsanfang war und immer dann viele neue Mitarbeiter ihren Dienst anfangen, durfte ich mir eine Nummer ziehen und  - gefühlt - ewig und drei Tage warten. Das mehr oder minder intelligente Ausgabegerät teilte mir freundlich mit, dass noch 27 Andere vor mir warten würden, was in ein unwillkürliches Aufstöhnen meinerseits resultierte. Genau so, wie ich es schon bei denen beobachten konnte, die vor mir dran waren.Hier ist das zuständige Referat für die Ausstellung von Hausausweisen angesiedeltMit dem neuen Mitarbeiterausweis konnte ich dann auch sogleich ohne lästige Sicherheitskontrollen ins Jakob-Kaiser-Haus. Damit kommt man überall hinein - nur gratis Eis gibt es damit nicht!Dann ging es auch schon an die Arbeit. Gut, besonders viel gab es noch nicht zu tun. Axel wies mich in die Geheimnisse des Büros ein, angefangen beim elektrischen Sonnenschutz, bis hin zur Sanitäranlage im Wandschrank. Auch meinen zukünftigen Arbeitsplatz inklusive Dienstnotebook durfte ich ebenso bestaunen. Nicht schlecht, damit lässt es sich arbeiten, könnte man an dieser Stelle sagen, ohne des Lügens bezichtigt zu werden. Ich bekam aufgetragen, morgens die Post zu holen. Freudig erregt ließ Axel mich wissen, dass Herr Kapschack zur CeBit eingeladen ist und er die Einladung “Ralf solange hinterhertragen [wird], bis er ja sagt”. Beim Thema Post erfuhr ich auch gleich noch, dass sämtliche Post zwar auf Ungefährlichkeit hin untersucht wird, sie aber ansonsten ohne Spam-Filter weitergeleitet wird. “Du glaubst gar nicht, für was für völlig absurde Sachen es alles eine Lobby gibt” klärte Axel mich auf und teilte mir im Anschluss mit, dass ich später beim Postsortieren helfen sollte, um einmal zu sehen, was alles nicht einmal dem Abgeordneten unter die Augen kommt, weil es zuvor aussortiert wird. Aber dann ging es erstmal zum Essen in die Kantine, wo es ein wirklich vorzügliches Essen für einen günstigen Preis von etwa drei Euro gibt. Auf dem Weg dorthin erklärte mir Axel, dass sämtliche Liegenschaften des Bundestags unterirdisch verbunden sind, und dass man, wenn man nicht will, keinen Fuss auf die Straße zu setzen braucht. Während des Essens erfuhr ich noch, dass Axel den Wahlkampf von Herrn Kapschak geleitet hatte, und dass er anschließend gefragt wurde, ob er nicht als wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter in Berlin arbeiten möchte. Wie ich dann noch erfahre, wird die Kantine von allen, die im Gebäude unterwegs sind, genutzt und deshalb kann man hier auch schonmal eine politische Berühmtheit treffen. “Letzte Woche war Peer Steinbrück hier”, bemerkt Axel. Ich versuche mich in die Situation hineinzuversetzen: Für mich wäre das in etwa so, als ob ein 14-jähriges Mädchen Justin Bieber in der Schulkantine treffen würde. Eine alberne Aussage? Das zu sagen wäre so, wie wenn ich Eulen für meine schlechten Vergleiche verantwortlich machen würde!Auf diesem Flur rechts liegt das BüroDas ist der PraktikantenarbeitsplatzSpieglein, Spieglein an der (Schrank-)Wand, wer ist die größte Koalition im Land?Okayes Internet&hellip; Nur gibt&rsquo;s kein WiFi, weil: zu teuer! Erst 2017! o_ONicht zu verkennen ist das extravagante Design der Sanitäranlagen im Paul-Löbe-Haus. Das dortige Interieur hat etwas so transzendentales und kontemplatives, dass so mancher, der nach einer hitzigen Debatte das stille Örtchen aufsuchte, anschließend durch sein Auftreten als Inkarnation der Ausgeglichenheit und Ruhe selbst überrascht haben dürfte.Meditationsraum oder doch nur Toilette? Vielleicht beides?Auch sonst manifestieren Architektur, Inneneinrichtung, ja sogar die Schilder vor den Büros mit jeder Faser, dass Deutschland die drittgrößte Volkswirtschaft der Welt ist. Die schon als Kunst zu betrachtende Architektur ist angereichert mit zahlreichen Kunstinstallationen, welche sich überall in den Gebäuden finden lassen.Aufzüge, wie Kulissen aus “2001 - eine Odyssee im Weltraum”Ein weiteres erstes Mal für mich, war die Begehung der Reichstagskuppel. Netterweise braucht man mit dem Hausausweis dafür nicht anstehen, sondern kann über einige recht verworrene Wege dorthin gelangen.Insgesamt ist es frappierend, wie leicht zugänglich das &ldquo;Herz der Demokratie&rdquo; doch ist. Beim Betreten der &ldquo;Liegenschaften des Bundestags&rdquo; scheint es mir irreal, wieso ich, der ich doch nur ein Feld-, Wald- und Wiesenbürger bin, Zutritt zu diesem eminent wichtigen Institutionen erhalte. Vielleicht ist es auch nur ein unterbewusstes Vorurteil, das vom bürgerfernen und weltfremden Politikbetrieb in der Hauptstadt, was zu diesem Eindruck führt.Als ich nach Berlin zog, und eines Nachts an der Spree am Reichstag und dem angrenzenden Paul-Löbe-Haus vorbeischlenderte, da dachte ich noch: Das sieht aber alles beeindruckend, imposant und jedoch auch hermetisch verriegelt aus - dass es dann doch so leicht ist, das ganze einmal von Innen zu betrachten, hätte ich nicht erwartet. Anscheinend muss man es nur wollen. Der Fall scheint ähnlich gelagert, wie der, den Christopher Lauer plakativ auf das fast aphoristische Diktum - Zitat Christopher Lauer - “Kein Schwanz interessiert sich für Politik&quot; - Zitat ende - bringt. Die Informationen und Möglichkeiten sind alle gegeben, nur muss man entsprechend die Informationen einholen und die Möglichkeiten nutzen. Dies tue ich zu wenig, und auch sonst tuen es bedauerlicherweise viel zu wenige.Nach Feierabend gehe ich noch zu einem Praktikantentreffen im Paul-Löbe-Haus, was - wie sich herausstellen sollte - jedoch erst am nächsten Tag stattfand. Zum Mindesten konnte ich so ein paar Bilder von der Architektur machen und mich wieder einmal mehr am erhabenen Essen delektieren.Das wichtigste zuerst!Die hübsche Kantine im Paul-Löbe-Haus&hellip;",

        "content": "Der “Chaos Communication Congress”  (Wiki) ist eine (in Nerdkreisen) sagenumwobene Veranstaltung, eine kunterbunte Zusammenkunft von Hackern, Bastlern, Technikaffinen und Interessierten. Einmal jährlich findet der vom Chaos-Computer-Club organisierte Kongress - nun schon seit ganzen 30 Jahren, also seit 1984 - statt. Anfänglich noch überschaubar und fast schon privat, ist der Kongress nun zu einer immensen Publikumsveranstaltung avanciert. So ist der Kongress seit dem letzten Jahr im CCH, dem Congress Center Hamburg, angesiedelt, da im vorherigen Stammplatz, dem BCC in Berlin, die Platzverhältnisse dem Besucherandrang nicht mehr gewachsen waren. Der letze Kongress in Berlin (2011) stand einem Besucherandrang von 4500 gegenüber. Der diesjährige Kongress wurde von ca. 9000! Besuchern frequentiert, was eine beträchtliche Steigerung gegenüber den 6600 Besuchern von 2012 darstellt.Auch von außen ganz hübsch: 30C3Die beeindruckende Infrastruktur mit eigenem DECT-Netz, GSM-Netz und einer eigenen 100 GBit/s Internetanbindung, die die zeitweise bis zu 5000 angemeldeten WLAN-Verbindungen speisen konnte, ist eine Einmaligkeit. Nur an wenigen Orten auf der Welt dürfte es eine ähnlich schnelle Internetanbindung gebenSchnelles InternetSehr schnelles InternetAlle Vorträge sind aufgezeichnet und frei zugänglich. Bemerkenswert ist, dass fast alle Vorträge mit Simultanübersetzung in jeweils Deutsch oder Englisch und mit Untertitelung zur Verfügung stehen. So etwas ist nur möglich, weil es ein Freiwilligensystem (Engelsystem) gab, welches auf über 1000 Freiwillige zurückgreifen konnte, die unentgeltlich den reibungslosen Ablauf der Veranstaltung in verschiedenen Bereichen sicherstellten. Nur so ist es möglich, dass die Tickets mit 80€ für eine Veranstaltung dieser Größenordnung recht erschwinglich sind. Wenn man nach günstigeren Tickets fragt, kann man auch einen Preisnachlass erhalten, wenn man nachvollziehbare Gründe angibt. So konnte ich mein Ticket für 40€ erhalten.Auch die Übernachtungsmöglichkeiten sind für jeden Geldbeutel ausgelegt, so kann - wer möchte - sich direkt in das unmittelbar am Kongresszentrum gelegene Radisson blu einquartieren. Wem das zu teuer ist (mir!), der kann in einer von zwei zur Verfügung stehenden Turnhallen übernachten. Dort kostet die Nacht nur 5€ und als ein In­cen­tive für die Freiwilligenarbeit ist das Übernachten für Kongressteilnehmer die “engeln” grundsätzlich kostenlos. Dafür teilt man sich den Platz mit mehreren Dutzend Menschen, deren vereinzelt nachgerade stupende Schnarcherei doch ein gewisse Imposanz hat und eine subtile Faszination ausübt. Auf der anderen Seite wiederum lässt das Schnarchen das Einschlafen zur Herausforderung werden. Die Lärmbelästigung dürfte von jedem Richter als fahrlässige Körperverletzung gewertet werden. Aber weil es ja nichts gekostet hat, beschwere ich mich mal nicht weiter.Die größte Herausforderung des Kongresses war allerdings das schnöde Auswählen der Vorträge/Workshops, die man besuchen wollte. Eine profane Angelegenheit, wie manch Einer meinen wird, jedoch auch nur, weil dieser Einer nicht den “Fahrplan”  zu Gesicht bekommen hat:Da kann man schon mal die Übersicht verlierenUnd das ist nur der Ablaufplan des ersten Tages. Jeden Tag aufs neue Veranstaltungen zu verpassen, weil mehrere hochinteressante Dinge parallel stattfinden, ist ein wenig ärgerlich, aber nicht zu vermeiden. Es gibt 4 “Tracks”, dass heißt es gibt immer 4 Vorträge, die zur gleichen Zeit gehalten werden. Daher bleibt einem nichts anderes übrig, als nach dem Kongress, die Video-Liste der verpassten Vorträge abzuarbeiten. Bei den Workshops gibt es so eine Möglichkeit natürlicherweise leider nicht.Los ging es am 27.12.2013, Tag 1 begann mit dem Opening-Event:Abgesehen von der Präsentation der opulenten Bühnentechnik, wurde in der Eröffnung das Hauptthema, die Enthüllungen rund um Edward Snowden gesetzt, welches sich wie ein roter Faden durch die gesamte Konferenz zog. Der Tenor des Opening-Events, war eine Art Schockstarre, angesichts der Offenbarwerdung des enormen Ausmaßes der flächendeckenden Überwachung. Aber auch die Aufforderung nicht in müßigen Defätismus zu verfallen und stattdessen nach Lösungen zu suchen war Teil der Botschaft.Am Abend des ersten Tages war der Vortrag von Glenn Greenwald anberaumt. Dieser war jedoch nur über Skype zugeschaltet, da er auf Anraten seiner Anwälte vorerst auf Reisen verzichtete. In seinem emphatischen Vortrag trug dieser seine Sicht zu den Enthüllungen Snowdens vor und ging auch auf die repressiven Gegenmaßnahmen von den USA und Großbritannien ein. Auch seine Entrüstung über den Fall Manning brachte Greenwald zum Ausdruck und kritisierte den Machtmissbrauch durch Regierungen, die Whistleblower mit Gerichtsverfahren und Strafverfolgung einzuschüchtern versuchen.Alles in allem verwischte Greenwald die Grenzen zwischen Journalismus und Aktivismus. Das er beides nicht trennscharf voneinander schied, kann man kritisch sehen, dennoch brachte Glenn Greenwald eloquent auf den Punkt, was die Konsequenzen des Snowden-Komplexes sind und welche Konsequenzen politisch gezogen werden sollten.Besondere Erwähnung verdient der Vortrag des ehemaligen Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragten Peter Schaar, der in eine informative Präsentation mit Witz und Charme zum eher trockenem Thema Datenschutz auf die Beine stellte. Vielsagend war dabei seine Zurückhaltung während der “Q&amp;A”, wenn es darum ging die neue Datenschutzbeauftragte Andrea Voßhoff in ihrer Eignung für das Amt zu bewerten. “Hierzu werde ich mich nicht äußern”, war alles, was ihm zu entlocken war, auch wenn es zahllose Versuche gab ihm ein konkretes Statement zu seiner Nachfolgerin zu entlocken. Insgesamt ist die Stellung des Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragten nach Schaars Lesart eine zu schwache. Zum einen ist der Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragte an das Innenministerium angegliedert (Dienstaufsicht), zum anderen verfügt er nicht über die Freiheit sein Personal eigenständig auszuwählen. Auch der Umstand, dass der Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragte wiedergewählt werden kann kritisierte Schaar. So plädierte er für eine Verlängerung der Amtszeit, bei gleichzeitigem Ausschluss einer Wiederwahl. Dadurch würde sich der Datenschutzbeauftragte nicht, um eine Amtszeitverlängerung sorgen und in der Folge entschiedener und souveräner agieren können. Aber, dass das Amt kein zahnloser Papiertiger sei, war ebenfalls den Äußerungen zu entnehmen. Am Ende des Vortrages wurde es ein wenig sentimental, als Schar stehende Ovationen für seine 10 Jahre geleistete Amtszeit erhielt. Zudem kündigte Schaar an, dass er ein Buch über seine Amtszeit schreiben wird und mit zahlreichen Vorträgen für eine Verbesserung der Stellung des Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragten eintreten wird.Interessant war nicht nur die Vielzahl an Vorträgen, Workshops und Installationen; nein, auch die Arbeit als “Angel”, also die Tätigkeit als Freiwilliger war höchst lehrreich. Dadurch ergab sich sowohl die Möglichkeit hinter die Kulissen einer solchen Großveranstaltung zu blicken, als auch die Möglichkeit neue Menschen kennenzulernen.So sieht der individuelle Zeitplan aus.Die Freiwilligenarbeit wird über eine Software, welche sich Engelsystem nennt, koordiniert. Man meldet sich an, erhält ein Umhängeschild und kann sich ab da an für Schichten eintragen. Den Anfang nahm das Ganze, als ich mich bemüßigt fühlte, mich für die Schicht mit der ominösen Beschreibung “Collect stuff for steph” einzutragen. Dabei ging es darum über das Kongresszentrum verteilte Schiebewagen einzusammeln und in die Lagerhalle zu bringen. Nicht sehr spannend, aber dadurch habe ich immerhin 2 sympathische Israelis kennengelernt und bin einmal in jede Ecke des Kongresses gekommen.Die nächste Schicht beinhaltete zur Unzeit in der Küche auszuhelfen, die für die Versorgung der Freiwilligen zuständig war. Ein Erlebnis, dass schon interessanter war, sich aber doch streckenweise etwas unterfordernd gestaltete.Zu sagen es schmeckt, wäre eine Halbwahrheit.Wirklich überraschend war, wie viel Spaß das Arbeiten in der Bar doch macht. Die triviale Aufgabe Leuten ein Bier, eine Mate oder was auch immer zu geben und die Bezahlung zu regeln ist eine so simple und doch frappierend befriedigende Aufgabe. Natürlich kann es auch daran gelegen haben, dass die Bar in der exzeptionellen “Lounge” angesiedelt war. Dort schienen in der Planung und beim Aufbau ausnahmslos Exzentriker das Heft in der Hand gehalten zu haben. Die imposante Lichtkulisse, die kristallklare Soundanlage und die Tatsache, dass ein echter Wasserwerfer in der Lounge vorzufinden war, gaben eine eindrucksvolle Kulisse ab. Am letzen Kongresstag, gab es für die Freiwilligen, die mehr als 10h abgeleistet hatten, ein spezielles T-Shirt.Der Bereich des Kongresses, auf dem die meiste Interaktion und rege Betriebsamkeit vorherrscht, ist die sogenannte “assembly hall”. Dort bauen verschiedene Organisationen (Verbände, Vereine, Verbund von Menschen) eine Art Stand auf, in welchem sie an ihren Projekten arbeiten und diese auch präsentieren, Workshops anbieten und einfach offen für Fragen sind.Schon leckerer - kostet allerdings auch GeldSo gibt es eine “Lockpick-Base”, in welcher einem als Anfänger, die Grundfertigkeiten des Lockpickings vermittelt werden. Auch wenn die ausliegenden Schlösser noch alle recht simpel sind, ist es dennoch ein beachtliches Glücksgefühl nach einigen Minuten mit Spezialwerkzeug am Schloss nesteln, zu fühlen wie der Schließzylinder rotiert und mit einem hörbaren Klacken aufspringt. Ein Lockpickingset zu erwerben, war auch gleich möglich.Sieht recht unspektakulär aus: LockpickingIn der Assembly des Raumzeitlabors, konnte man nicht nur Löten erlernen, sondern sich gleich ein kleines LED-Amulett zusammenbauen. Nach länglichem dilettieren mit Lötzinn- und Kolben an den Schaltkreisen, brachte auch ich es irgendwann zustande, das Nerd-Kleinod zum Laufen zu bringen. Dank der auf dem Kongress allgegenwärtigen Hilfsbereitschaft, bekam ich nach ein wenig Herumfragen schlankweg einen halben Meter Kabel geschenkt, womit ich das Hacklace mit einem größeren Batteriepack ausstatten konnte.Auch nicht zu vergessen ist das sogenannte Yarn bombing/Guerilla Knitting http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerilla_Knitting, was sich reger Beliebtheit erfreute. Die dabei spontan entstandenen Strickwaren sind ein besonderer “eye catcher”, der oft erst auf den zweiten Blick auffällt.Insgesamt lässt sich resümieren, dass ein Besuch des “Chaos Communication Congress” auf jeden Fall ein lohnenswertes Unterfangen ist. Man lernt unglaublich viel in sehr kurzer Zeit, kommt in Kontakt mit neuen Ideen und Gedanken und nicht zuletzt gibt allein schon die einmalige Atmosphäre und Kulisse einem Grund genug, einmal vorbeizuschauen. Man trifft ausschließlich auf aufgeschlossene, hilfsbereite und mitdenkende Menschen, was für sich genommen in dieser Größenordnung auch schon ein Erlebnis ist. Oder konziser gesagt geschrieben: Wer nicht hingeht, der verpasst was!",

        "content": "Der Rest fehlt noch… (Note to self: Restzeitraum von Mittwoch bis Montag auch noch einstellen!) Gemacht?: Nope!Den Rest des Tages verbringe ich damit Souvenirs für die Daheimgebliebenen zu finden. Freundlicherweise helfen mir dabei Sascha, Nastya, Katya, Katya (Ja, es gibt zwei!), Mydygma und Sveta. Nach dem Abklappern der einschlägigen Geschäfte und dem Kauf zweier - an Kitsch schwerlich zu überbietender - Kühlschrankmagneten, leuchtet mir doch ein, dass es nicht die originellste Idee ist, aus China nach Russland importierte Souvenirs nach Deutschland zu nehmen, die hier den Touristen angepriesen werden, wie ehemals die Glasperlenketten den Indianern. Also dann vielleicht Lederhandschuhe denke ich, doch im Kaufhaus merke ich schnell, dass sie optisch wie preislich ihren deutschen Äquivalenten in nichts nachstehen. Daher wäre auch das wohl ein witzloser Kauf denke ich und kaufe zwei Paar. Ich frage, ob nicht russischer Wodka ein gutes Souvenir wäre, doch dieser Gedanke stößt auf geharnischte Gegenrede. Dies wäre doch zu klischeehaft und würde nur dem Stereotyp von Russland als “Wodkakonsumierende Menschen, die lustige Bärenfellmützen tragen” Vorschub leisten, heißt es. Aus Verzweiflung schlage ich vor in den Supermarkt zu gehen, um dort vielleicht noch etwas typisch russisches zu finden. Der Supermarkt ist nicht groß, ich blicke auf eingemachte rote Beete, Gewürzgurken und Dosenananas. Nicht grade sehr einzigartig. Nachdem ich den Supermarkt mit ähnlichen Ergebnissen mehrmals durchstreift habe, kommt mir plötzlich die Erleuchtung! Nicht in Deutschland zu haben. Typisch Russisch. Haltbar. Robust. Freude machend. Genial. Verboten gut. All diese Attribute treffen auf das Objekt meiner Begierde zu. Ich nehme soviel ich tragen kann in meine Arme und ende schließlich mit einer Tüte, welche so aussieht:Nur was ist in der Tüte? Nun, die Antwort mag überraschen, aber darin befinden sich mehrere kleinere Tüten!Nun zur Auflösung, es handelt sich bei diesen Tütchen um die Verpackungen von gerösteten Brotwürfeln - quasi Croutons -; bloß ist es so, dass diese russische Variation nicht für die Suppe oder den Salat gedacht ist, sondern direkt gegessen wird. Das Ganze gibt es in den verschiedensten Geschmacksrichtungen: Von Bacon, Hähnchen, Salami bis hin zu Barbecue und vielem mehr. Eine Investition, die sich bezahlt macht; bzw. eine, die schmeckt.Nach dem getanen Souvenirkauf beschließen wir etwas völlig verrücktes, nämlich ein Eis zu essen. Wir setzen uns an einen Tisch, der in der Nähe eines Subways steht. Sascha, der wieder einmal mehr zur Inkarnation von Wahn-, Aber- und Irrwitz wird, sorgt für lautes Gelächter, was einen leicht unseriös wirkenden Mann in einer blauen Daunenjacke auf den Plan ruft. Der besagte Mann schaut bärbeißig drein und sagt irgendetwas auf Russisch. Mir wird erklärt, dass er gesagt hat, dass wir leiser sein sollten. Ich verstehe nicht, warum man auf einen unseriösen Mann hören sollte, nur weil man nicht hysterisch, sondern ganz normal Lacht. Auch seine markante, weil baby-blaue, Daunenjacke ändert daran nichts. Nach einer kurzen Weile sagt der Mann wieder etwas und zu meiner Überraschung stehen Alle auf und sagen mir, dass wir besser wo anders hingehen. Andere weniger moralisch und sittlich gefestigte Personen hätten womöglich nach dem Motto “Gewalt ist meine Währung und ich möchte bitte zahlen!” gehandelt, doch ich staune nur ungläubig, stehe auf und frage mich, warum alle auf diesen fremden Mann hören. Beim Gehen stelle ich fest, dass der Daunenjackenmann ganz ungeniert hinter den Subway-Tresen getreten ist und nun dort das Geld in der Kasse zählt. Verleiht ihm seine Jacke in diesem Teil der Welt etwa eine besondere Autorität will ich mich grade fragen, als mir ein Licht aufgeht. Könnte es etwa sein, dass der erlauchte Herr der Ladenbesitzer ist? Da die Evidenz bekanntlich irgendwann zur Anerkennung der Realität zwingt, rubriziere ich den Daunenjackenmann ab nun als Subwaymann.Nach diesem Erlebnis gehen wir noch in einen Copy-Shop. Als Abschiedsgeschenk dachte ich an ein paar Kopien eines meiner Lieblingsbilder, die in Ulan-Ude entstanden sind. An einem Nachmittag, an dem ich nicht viel zu tuen hatte, habe ich so lange auf meinen Android-Smartphone an den Parametern herumgespielt, bis dabei das folgende Bild entstand:“Welcome to Russia”Beim Ausdrucken kam ich mir vor, wie Andreas Gursky, nur mit dem Unterschied, dass er sich beim Druck auf die hernach folgende Millionengage freuen kann.Langsam wurde es auch schon spät und es wurde Zeit loszugehen, um rechtzeitig zum vereinbarten Treffpunkt zu gelangen. Das letzte Treffen mit Irina, Lisa, Sascha, Oyuna und Anaida für die nächste Zeit. Da ich dem Vorschlag uns in einem Subway zu treffen nichts entgegenzusetzen hatte, verabschiedete ich mich von Sveta und Mydygma und ging zusammen mit Sascha und Katya (die zweite) zum Subway. Angekommen und während wir warten, stellen Katya und ich fest, dass wir im selben Wohnblock wohnen. Doch damit nicht genug, nein sie wohnt sogar direkt in der Wohnung unter meinen. Und trotzdem haben wir uns die letzten 3 Wochen nicht gesehen, wohl weil ich eher selten früh aufstehen musste. Als die Anderen kommen, spüre ich die in mir aufkeimende Wehmut. All diese Menschen werde ich für mindestens ein halbes Jahr nicht mehr sehen können; höchstens deren Bits und Bytes, die die 7500 Kilometer zwischen uns mühelos, in weniger als einem Wimpernschlag, zu überwinden vermögen. Ich teile meine Bilddrucke aus und versehe sie mit Widmungen. Das Reflektieren über die gemeinsame Zeit macht mich nicht grade glücklicher darüber, dass heute mein letzter Tag an diesem Ort für eine lange Zeit sein wird. Ich habe ja schon ein Abschiedsgeschenk erhalten, dennoch bekomme ich noch einen Schminkspiegel, ein Gummiband und eine alte kommunistische Schrift, die ich hoffentlich bald lesen kann:Irgendwann muss Katya schließlich nach Hause, wir bringen sie zu ihrer Wohnung und tatsächlich: Sie wohnt nur ein Stockwerk unter meinem. Schließlich gehen wir zu Anaida und Irinas Wohnung, wobei sich Sascha am Busbahnhof, der auf dem Weg liegt verabschiedet. Da waren es nur noch drei. Die Frage ist, was ist besser? Es ist wie beim lösen eines alten Pflasters: Lieber schnell und alles auf einmal? Oder lieber langsam Stück für Stück? Den Rest des Abends versuche wir ein Video zu drehen, für das “Ask me i&rsquo;m local”-Projekt an dem Anaida teilnimmt. Nach einer Weile bringe ich diesen Text zu Papier:Hi, I&rsquo;m Marcus and I&rsquo;m in Germany now. I like my hometown. I like my homecity. I like my german friends and family&hellip;But, that&rsquo;s not everything I have to say. Because last month I&rsquo;ve been to Buryatia. I think a friend told me about this project called &ldquo;Ask me, I&rsquo;m local&rdquo;. I wasn&rsquo;t sure about this, but I&rsquo;ve tried it anyway. On my second day Anaida called me and invited over to her flat, where she introduced me to her friends. Together they showed me all of Ulan-Ude. I got to learn about the students&rsquo; life, even got to visit a real russian physics lecture. Ochen&rsquo; interesno!-I can say. Anaida really helped me to immerse myself in this city unlike as a nomad tourist who will always be outstanding even after two weeks. In this time and I would never have thought that I became so fond of Buryatia, that I really want to come back. When I came to Buryatia I would never have dreamed that I would be welcomed with so much hospitality. What really made a difference was Anaida and her friends whom I want to thank from the bottom of my heart. I really think that this &ldquo;Ask me, I&rsquo;m local&rdquo; project is something extraordinary. It is a great opportunity for intercultural exchange and that in such a personal way. I hope this concept will catch on and spread. I really like this Idea and i hope it will show many more foreigners how awesome russia is. Best regards from Germany, bye.Jedoch wird die Aufnahme so schlecht, dass ich das ganze später in Deutschland noch einmal aufnehmen musste. Wie auch immer. Irgendwann gegen 3 fällt uns auch kein Grund mehr ein den Abschied noch weiter hinauszuzögern. Wir gehen Richtung Wohnung, auf der Hälfte der Strecke bleiben wir stehen. Wir reden solange bis wir merken, dass niemand den ersten Schritt machen will. Irgendwann macht ihn dann noch jemand, ich weiß nicht mehr genau wer. Wir sagen “Lebe wohl” (zu pathetisch?) und gehen schließlich in entgegengesetze Richtungen, nicht ohne von Zeit zu Zeit einander frenetisch zu Winken. Abschiede sind nie eine angenehme Sache.Goodbye Ulan-ude",

        "content": "Der Dienstag fängt auch eher beschaulich an: Schlafen bis 12, dann Essen. Ich treffe ich mich mit einer Deutschstudentin, die mein Seminar besucht hatte. Ich stelle fest, dass ihr Deutsch und ihr Englisch leider mehr radebrechen, denn sprechen ist. Zwar ist sie noch nicht lange Deutschstudentin, dennoch verwundert mich ihr sehr basales Englisch doch etwas. Wir gehen zusammen in das große Stadion der Stadt, in dem grade eine Jugendmannschaft trainiert. Die Wachposten lassen uns - zu meinem Erstaunen - einfach hinein.Denn Rest des Tages schaue ich 60% von “Koyaanisqatsi” und 80% von “Lethal Weapon 3”, bei letzterem frage ich mich, wer solche Filme bitte schauen soll, bevor ich meine Frage - wenige Sekunden später - zurückziehe.Als ich feststelle, dass mein Datenvolumen noch 1.8GB Datenübertragung zulässt, beschließe ich meinen “Breaking Bad”-Rückstand aufzuholen. Flugs finde ich in der Piratenbucht - dem probaten Videorekorder meiner Wahl - den Sendungsmitschnitt, der kompakte 377MB misst. Hotspot-Tethering sei Dank, fließt der Datenstrom - Bittorrent sei Dank - mit stattlichen 800kb/s vom Sendemast durch die Luft zu meinem Nexus 4 und dann abermals auf dem Luftweg zu meinem MacBook. Nach dem ich Episode 14 geschaut habe, bin ich so aufgewühlt, dass ich weitere 377MB Datenvolumen auf den Kopf haue um mir Episode 15 auf die Festplatte - ja, ich habe noch rotierendes Metall in meinem Computer - zu zaubern. Die Macher verstehen ihr Handwerk.Soviel 3G gabs noch nie! Wer den plötzliche Ansprung einordnen kann, hat wahrscheinlich den obigen Text gelesen.Um 6 steht ein Besuch des hiesigen Bierhauses, auf Einladung von Herrn Karpov und seiner Frau, an. Wir - Bettina, Vater, Karpov, seine Frau und moí - fahren mit einem Taxi durch die teils verstopften Straßen Ulan-Udes zum Bierhaus. Es handelt sich dabei um ein Restaurant und Hotel mit angeschlossener Brauerei. Der Besitzer hat anscheinend ein echtes Faible für deutsche Braukunst. Daher heißt das Bierhaus auch “Bierhaus” und im Inneren findet sich allerlei deutsches: von Bierkrügen, Humpen bis hin zu den Speisen. Beim Essen erfahre ich noch, das mein Vater vor vielen Jahrzehnten wohl einmal eine russische Geliebte hatte von der er getrennt wurde, weil es damals noch ein Unding war mit einem Ausländer zu bandeln. Sein Pech, mein Glück. Auch gesellt sich im Laufe des Abends noch ein korpulenter “Deputat”, ein Bekannter Herrn Karpovs, dazu, der als parteiloser Abgeordnete im Parlament der autonomen Republik Buryatien sitzt. Bisher habe ich Russland eher als monolithische Struktur wahrgenommen. Doch Russland trägt nicht umsonst offiziell den Namen Russische Föderationen. Allein in Buryatien findet man eine Diversität - an Bräuchen, Ethnien, Sprachen, Kulinarischem, Kultur und mehr -, die davon zeugt, dass Russland ein Vielvölkerstaat sein muss. Auch wenn ich historisch nicht bewandert bin, die Tatsache, dass es eine buryatische Sprache gibt, legt Zeugnis davon, dass in einem wahrscheinlich Jahrhunderte dauernden und mit Sicherheit immer noch fortdauernden Prozess, dieser Landstrich von Russland in Besitz genommen wurde. Mit der Folge, dass das Buryatische auszusterben droht und irgendwann einmal, auch die letzten kulturellen Eigenheiten assimilieren und nur noch ein asiatisches Aussehen als Zeugnis der “Annexion” bleibt. Vielleicht ist das aber auch nur Unsinn den ich mir mit meinem gefährlichen Halbwissen zusammenreime. Jedenfalls erzählt der Abgeordnete davon, dass sein Großvater im 2. Weltkrieg ein Bein verloren hat und dass sein weiterer Großvater in Stalingrad gefallen sei. Deshalb wäre er in die Politik gegangen, weil er glaubt, dass der Krieg ein Versagen der damaligen Politiker gewesen sei. Bevor der Deputat geht, gibt es noch ein obligatorisches Anstoßen auf die russischen Frauen. Das dürfe nicht fehlen, wie mir versichert wird.",

        "content": "Am Montag wache ich gegen 7 auf und schaffe es noch eben zu duschen, meine Tasche zu packen und da ist es auch schon 7:37. Ich bringe es noch zustande einen Jogurt - samt Löffel - einzupacken und sprinte aus der Tür. Ich schaue in meinen Geldbeutel, aus dem mir 10 klägliche Rubel zu sagen scheinen: Du hast ein Problem. Die Fahrt mit Bahn oder Bus kostet nämlich leider 15 Rubel. Gezwungenermaßen muss ich also wieder einmal einen Marathon, der unschöneren Art, antreten. Dejavu: Das habe ich doch schon mal machen müssen! Immerhin schaffe ich es so in Rekordverdächtigen 12 Minuten die Strecke zwischen Wohnung und Sovietplatz zu durchmessen. Angekommen stelle ich fest, dass Ira noch gar nicht da ist. Da ich selbst auch ein Freund der “african time” bin, ärgere ich mich nicht, sondern freue mich eher, dass ich nun doch noch frühstücken kann. Zwar nur einen, im Geschmack durchschnittlichen, Jogurt - aber besser als nichts.Als Ira schließlich auch da ist, verrät sie mir, dass der Professor ohnehin meist eine Viertelstunde zu spät ist. Also begeben wir uns zum Unigebäude und dort in die 2. Etage zum Ort der Vorlesung. Thema: Mechanik. Verwundert stelle ich fest, dass nur knapp 10 Studenten vor der Tür stehen und auf ihren Professor warten. Nach einer kurzen Vorstellung teilen mir die Erstsemester auf meine Nachfrage mit, dass tatsächlich nicht noch mehr kommen werden. Leider muss ich auch hier wieder die Erfahrung machen, dass eine erhebliche Sprachbarriere besteht. Entweder die Studenten sprechen nur sehr schlecht Englisch oder sie sind zu eingeschüchtert Englisch zu sprechen. So muss Ira ein wenig übersetzen. Tatsächlich kommt nach 10 Minuten der Physikprofessor. Er ist ein Mann gehobenen Alters. Sein Gesicht ist von Falten gezeichnet und er trägt einen Pullover und eine ein bisschen zu weit geschnittene Anzughose. Der Raum, in dem die Vorlesung gehalten wird, gleicht eher einem Klassenzimmer. Es gibt Tische mit jeweils zwei Stühlen und eine Tafel an der vorderen Raumseite. Zudem fällt auf, dass der Raum nicht beheizt ist und, dass die Leuchtstoffröhrenlampen an der Decke zu einem hohen Prozentsatz kaputt sind. Als der Professor den Raum betritt stehen alle Studenten zur Begrüßung auf. Ich verstehe nicht, was der Professor sagt, aber von den Formeln, die er an die Tafel schreibt, kann ich ablesen, dass das Thema der Vorlesung kreisförmige Bewegungen sind. Ab und zu schnappe ich einzelne Wörter auf, wie Vektor oder die universalen Größenbezeichnungen. Abgesehen davon fällt auf, dass der Professor wohl gerne einmal abschweift. So höre ich etwa einmal die Wörter “Michael Jackson” heraus und  entnehme Iras Lachen, dass es sich hierbei wohl nicht um physikbezogene Inhalte handelt.Später erzählt sie mir, dass sie früher auch ein Physikstudium angefangen hat und auch bei diesem Professor Unterricht hatte. Der Professor schweift gerne einmal ab, wie Ira bestätigt. Gerne würde er “fun facts” aus den Werken Freuds in den Unterrichtsverlauf einstreuen. Nach dieser Vorlesung, bietet Ira an, noch eine “Lektsia”  zu “mathematical analysis” zu besuchen, was ich dankend ablehne. Stattdessen gehen wir in die Unimensa essen. Vorher hebe ich noch Geld ab: 2000 Rubel; was mir eine Abbuchung von 46€ auf meinem Konto beschert, wie ich später sehe. Nach dem Essen zeigt Ira mir noch die Unibibliothek. Es gibt zwar auch Computerverzeichnisse des Sortiments, jedoch gibt es auch riesige Schränke mit Schubladen, welche Karteikarten enthalten, auf denen - teilweise handschriftlich - vermerkt ist, welches Buch wo zu finden ist. Um 11:20 muss Ira schließlich zu ihrer Biologievorlesung und ich bin auf mich selbst gestellt. Ich frage Oyuna und Anaida, ob sie an der Uni sind, doch beide sind es nicht. So begebe ich mich in die Unibibliothek um mich ein wenig im Uniwifi an der Internetverbindung zu laben. Doch mein iPad möchte sich partout nicht mit dem Wifinetzwerk verbinden. Also gehe ich nach einer Weile zurück zur Wohnung. Dort schreibe ich noch einen weiteren CS-Host an, ob er mich Mittwoch und Donnerstag beherbergen könnte. Igor bejaht, schreibt mir jedoch am Dienstag, dass es am Mittwoch doch nicht geht.",

Die “Marschutka” steuert zwar - wie gewünscht - den Sovietplatz an, bloß steigen wir, in Ermangelung von Ortskunde, auf der falschen Seite zu. So gibt es eine längere, unerbetene Stadtrundfahrt für immerhin in ökonomischer Hinsicht akzeptable 15 Rubel. Den Rest des Tages schreibe ich in der Wohnung an meinem Reisetagebuch, wobei ich mir meine bescheidene iTunesbibliothek mehrere Male durchhöre. Außerdem verabrede ich mit Anaida, dass Ira am Montag mit mir eine Physik-“Lektsia” besuchen wird. Leider um 8 in der Frühe.

        "content": "Nachdem ich mich unter der Aufbringung schier übermenschlichen Kräfte um 2 Uhr fast pünktlich zum Sovietplatz begebe, finde ich Nastya mit einer Studienfreundin und dem Au-Pair Nora vor. Da ich schon beim kleinen tibetischen Datsan war, beschließt Nastya, dass wir zum größten russischen Datsan fahren, dem Datsan bei Iwolginsk. Sogar der Dalai Lama persönlich war schon einmal in diesem Datsan. Die Fahrt mit der “Marschutka” dauert knapp 40 Minuten. Wieder einmal mehr legt der Fahrer einen Fahrstil an den Tag, der einen Glauben macht, man befände sich nicht in einem Kleinbus älteren Semesters, sondern in einem fabrikfrischen Porsche Cayenne. Angekommen staunte ich nicht schlecht: Selbst im tiefsten Sibirien in einem buryatischen, buddhistischen Kloster, hatte sich der Kapitalismus Bahn gebrochen: Gleich am Eingang wurden die Besucher von einer kleinen Armada an Verkaufsständen in Empfang genommen, die von billigstem Tand bis hin zu passablen Handschuhen alles anboten. Es folgte ein Gang über den vorgegebenen Rundweg auf dem man allerhand Gebetsmühlen passiert, an welchen man Kleingeld in eine Dose wirft, um die Gebetsmühle anschließend, je nach Glaubensfestigkeit, unterschiedlich enthusiastisch zu drehen.Als wir das erste Gebäude betreten bin ich doch erstaunt: Selbst in der heiligen Stätte ist doch tatsächlich ein kleiner Laden, der Minigebetstrommeln und heilige Getränke und vieles mehr feilbietet. Wenigstens im Hauptgebäude sind solche äußersten Vorposten des Kapitalismus, die von der Totalität des selben zeugen, nicht zu finden. Es ist schon faszinierend, dass meine immaterielle Arbeitsleistung in Deutschland im fernen Sibirien noch auf Akzeptanz stößt und gegen einen anderen Wert eintauschbar ist. Im Hauptgebäude findet sich jedoch ein Foto mit dem - wie immer - ausdruckslos dreinschauenden Putin, welches unmissverständlich dokumentiert, dass dieser auch an diesem Ort schon einmal war und, dass ihn auch hier nichts anficht. Vor dem Tempel befindet sich ein kleines hölzernes Podest, das einen Stein beherbergt. Ich erfahre von Nastyas Freundin Anna, dass man sich etwas wünschen kann, und wenn man mit verschlossenen Augen, von einer etwa 15 Meter entfernten Startmakierung, den Stein mit der Hand erreicht, gehe der Wunsch in Erfüllung. Anna, Nastya und Nora scheitern mal mehr mal weniger knapp. Ich schaffe es tatsächlich den Stein zu erreichen, wobei ich ehrlicherweise zugeben muss, dass ich - aus Angst mir doch die Hirse irgendwo an einer der ubiquitären Gebetsmühlen anzuwemmsen - kurz geblinzelt habe, was natürlich ein kleiner Vorteil war. Wie dem auch sei, nach dem Datsanbesuch gehen wir noch Buzy essen. Buzy ist das buryatische Nationalgericht und besteht aus einer Teigtasche, die mit einer Fleischfüllung daherkommt und das im buddhistischen Datsan: “Welcome to russia” denke ich mir, da es mir diesmal niemand, wie schon so oft, sagt. Optisch und geschmacklich ist Buzy fast genauso, wie die chinesischen Baozi. Dazu gibt es den typischen “Chai s moloka”, den schwarzen Tee mit Milch. Nach Speis und Trank wird es noch ein wenig spannend. Nastya sagt, man könne mit einem der Mönche sprechen, ähnlich wie mit einem Pfarrer in Deutschland. Mit dem Unterschied, dass - wie ich später feststelle - der hiesige Mönch sich dazu verstiegen hat die Zukunft voraussagen zu wollen und sogar recht eigenwillige Ratschläge erteilt. Doch dazu später mehr. Zuerst einmal heißt es, sich auf die Suche nach einem Mönch zu machen, was schwerer ist als man denkt. Die Mönche leben verteilt auf dem Gelände des Datsan in kleinen Häuschen, wobei immer mehrere Schüler mit einem Meister zusammen leben. Auch interessant ist, dass die Mönche im Gegensatz zu, etwa katholischen Priestern, problemlos eine Frau und Familie haben dürfen. Bloß ist der Datsan nur den Männern vorbehalten. Die Aufschreidebatte dürfte bis nach Sibirien wohl noch eine Weile brauchen. Nach vielem Türöffnen und Fragen deutet schließlich ein angehender Mönch auf ein kleines Holzgebäude. In dem Häuschen angekommen, fällt einem als erstes ein Schwall von Räucherstäbchendüften auf, in welchen die gesamte Behausung getaucht zu seien scheint. Wir kommen in einen kleinen Wartesaal, in welchem schon ein junges Pärchen sitzt. Gegenüber der Tür hinter einem Sichtschutz sitzt ein Mönch mittleren Alters und schlägt eifrig in Schriften nach, lässt kleine Steinchen fallen und singt monotone Mantren. Offenbar befindet er sich noch in einer Sitzung oder sollte man besser Beratung sagen? Wie auch immer. Nach einer ganzen Weile - gefühlt ewig und drei Tage - sind also wir an der Reihe. Zuerst lassen sich Nastya und ihre Freundin beraten. Nastya fragt, ob der Mönch ihr zu einem Deutschlandbesuch rät und ihre Freundin fragt nach Tipps zum Studium. Als ich an der Reihe bin frage ich “Was ist der beste Tipp, den sie jemandem geben können?”. Doch Nastya meint, dass diese Frage zu philosophisch sei und daher bekomme ich nach ihrer nicht ganz worttreuen Übersetzung stattdessen die Zukunft vorausgesagt. Und Tipps, wie ich mich verhalten sollte gibt es obendrein. Lediglich Name und Geburtsdatum muss ich nennen. Schon geht es los: Hefte werden durchblättert, Steinchen in eine Metallschachtel fallen gelassen und am Ende blickt der Mönch starr an die ihm gegenüberliegende Wand, wobei er seinen Körper anspannt und die Augen, welche er halb geschlossen hat, verdreht. Nach dieser Einlage fällt die Prognose um so enttäuschender aus. Mein bester Monat solle der Juni 2014 sein und ich würde auch sonst ein erfolgreiches Jahr erwarten können. Als Tipps bekomme ich mitgeteilt, dass ich nicht nach Westen und Süden reisen soll, dass ich nichts fettes essen soll und dass ich nichts gelbes kaufen soll. Als Nastya dies übersetzt kann ich mir ein Lachen kaum verkneifen und ich frage mich ob der Mönch selbst seinen Prognosen glauben schenkt oder ob er wider besseren Wissens abergläubische Menschen verschaukelt. Aus einem vielleicht falschen Respekt heraus reiße ich mich dennoch zusammen. Ich setzte erneut an und möchte fragen, wieso der Mönch Buddhist geworden ist. Doch auch hier weißt mich Nastya darauf hin, dass ich nur Fragen über mich stellen dürfe. Gezwungenermaßen beschließe ich nach meinem Physik- und Informatikstudium zu fragen. Der Mönch geht die gesamte schon alt bekannte Zeremonie abermals durch und teilt mir schließlich mit überzeugtem Blick und fester Stimme (von Nastya übersetzt) mit, dass ich Erfolg im Informatikstudium haben würde, aber im Physikstudium bekäme ich Probleme und ich solle daher aufpassen. Immer noch verwundert über diese eher “Astro-TV”eske Vorstellung nehme ich dies mit leicht schiefer Miene zur Kenntnis. Als wir schließlich alle das kleine Holzhäuschen verlassen, nicht ohne eine kleine Spende zu hinterlassen bin ich immer noch leicht verwundert. Ich gebe dem Mönch 100 Rubel, auch wenn mir seine obskure Vorstellung doch eher als Scharlatanerie, denn als unter Religionsfreiheit geschützte Tradition vorkam. Ich gebe ihm ein Tütchen Haribo, woran der Mönch offenbar Gefallen findet, zumindest seinem Bearbeiten der Tüte, wie es sonst bei einer Gebetskette üblich wäre, nach zu urteilen. Ich frage nach, ob Nastya und ihre Freundin den Ratschlag und die Prognose ernst nehmen, was beide zu meinem Erstaunen bejahen. Wobei sie auch mit mir über unsere Prognosen witzeln, was mir doch zeigt, dass sie das Ganze auch nicht ganz für Voll nehmen. Wir gehen noch kurz hinter den Datsan, wo neben einer atemberaubenden Szenerie auch ein Hain voller Bäumchen mit bunten Bändern vorzufinden ist. Die Bändchen werden zum Neujahrsfest von den Gläubigen angebracht. Dem Glauben nach fahren im Anschluss Geister in Form von Wind durch die Bänder und lesen, was auf ihnen steht.Die Rückfahrt gestaltet sich halsbrecherisch wie immer, wobei sogar noch ein Beinahe-Unfall auf dem Programm steht. Der Fahrer kann mit einem beherzten Tritt aufs Bremspedal schlimmeres noch gerade verhindern. Ein kleiner Junge, der neben seiner Mutter vor sich hin döst, ist davon nicht sonderlich beeindruckt und döst weiter. Ein echter russischer Junge, denke ich mir. Davon abgesehen erfahre ich noch von Nora, dass sie des Öfteren von russischen Männern angesprochen wird, die meist auch eine beträchtliche Alkoholfahne vorweisen und die traditionelle Tracht der “Gopniki” (was wohl soviel, wie Azzlacks heißt) aus dem Hause Adidas auftragen. Wir beschließen uns am nächsten Wochenende noch einmal auf ein Bier zu treffen.  Am Abend ergibt sich die Situation, dass ich mir - 3GB-SIM sei Dank - einen VK-Account anlege (Der Unterschied zu Facebook ist, dass dort nicht NSA und CIA sondern KGB und FSB die Daten abschnorcheln. Remember, huh?).",

Die Speisen sind opulent und fischzentriert. Nachdem die Gruppe sich daran gütlich tat ging es zum, das mausgrau des wolkenverhangen Himmels widerspiegelden, Baikalsee. Am Abend werde ich Zeuge eines echten russischen Gelages. Es gibt reichlich Wodka und Fisch. Jeder, der sich berufen fühlt steht einfach auf und hält eine Rede auf die Jubilarin, welche in einem Heben und Leeren der Wodkagläser kulminiert. Den Rekord stellt die zweitälteste Professorin mit einer Rede von gefühlten dreißig Minuten auf. Nicht weniger interessant nimmt sich das Singen von russischen und buryatischen Liedern am Tisch aus. Gegen Ende des Abends wird zu “Cherry cherry lady” von Dieter Bohlen getanzt. Keine alte russische Tradition, wie ich annehme. Die Unterkunft ist auch recht schön.Ich schaue zum Firmament und stelle enttäuscht fest, dass kein einziger Stern zu sehen ist. So wird auch heute nicht die Nacht sein, an der ich zum ersten Mal, nach 18 Jahren, die Milchstraße mit eigenen Augen sehe. Am nächsten Tag steht noch der Besuch eines Thermalbads an und danach geht es auch schon wieder zurück. Doch zuvor erfahre ich noch beim Mittagessen, wie hart das Leben als Englischdozentin hier ist. Eine sehr nette, jüngere Dozentin berichtet, dass sie nicht mehr dazu kommt russische Texte zu lesen, sondern nur noch die englische Lektüre für den Unterricht liest. Vorher stellt mich Herr Karpov einer anderen Professorin vor, die früher einmal Chinesisch unterrichtet hat. Wir schaffen es etwa 10 Minuten auf Chinesisch zu konversieren, bevor wir auf Englisch wechseln. Ich merke wieder einmal, dass ich meinen Wortschatz aufbessern sollte.Auf der Rückfahrt kommen wir an einer bildschönen buddhistischen Anlage vorbei. Die Bäume im klaren Licht des nun nicht mehr verhangenem Himmel bilden einen erhebenden Anblick.Zudem fahren wir noch an einer Fischfabrik vorbei und machen dort einen kurzen Halt.Wieder in Ulan-Ude angekommen frage ich Frau Nagusch nach der Telefonnummer von Nastya. Diese bekomme ich auch prompt. Doch damit nicht genug: Frau Nagusch ruft gleich auch noch an und drückt mir, mit meinem verdutzten Gesichtsausdruck ihr Handy in die Hand. So frage ich nach dem geplanten Treffen mit dem Au-Pair aus Berlin. Ich erfahre, dass am Samstag eine Besichtigung eines Datsans um 12 Uhr geplant ist. Dieser Termin wird jedoch später aus mir unerfindlichen Gründen auf 2 Uhr verschoben. Wieso schreibe ich dies dann auf? Weiß auch nicht? Vielleicht hat es mich unnötigerweise irritiert? Po hui! Als ich in der kargen Wohnung ankomme beschieße ich das Wochenende erst einmal in der Wohnung zu schlafen und nicht meine Gastgeberin zu belasten, bzw. mich selbst von ihrer etwas bemutternden Art zu entlasten. ",

Stattdessen gab es im Stadion der Universität einen Tag lang Sportwettkämpfe und eine große Eröffnungsshow. Ich war mit Yana dort und stellte erstaunt fest, dass inmitten der Menge eine Traube von circa 8 Chinesinnen stand, die sich auf Chinesisch unterhielten. In Sibirien. Na ja, so ist die globalisierte Welt.Hier sieht man, warum es Russische Föderationen heißt.Nach etwa der Hälfte der Eröffnungszeremonie, der ich von der Tribüne aus beiwohnte, ging Yana mit mir, Sascha, Ochirma und einem anderen Mädchen, dessen Name mir partout nicht einfallen will, zu Mittag essen bei Appetite - eine kleine Kette, die gutes Essen zu erschwinglichen Preisen anbietet. Die Besonderheit war, dass beide Mädchen vom Land kamen und ich anscheinend der erste Ausländer war, den sie gesehen hatten. Englisch sprachen die Beiden nicht, oder sie waren nicht gewillt Englisch zu sprechen. Jedenfalls konnte das Mädchen - was wegen meines löchrigen Gedächtnisses auch weiter ohne Namen bleibt: Mea culpa und Asche auf mein Haupt! - etwa 5 Minuten ein paar Sätze auf Chinesisch mit mir austauschen, da sie Chinesisch studierte. Danach liefen wir noch ein wenig durch die Stadt. Am nächsten Tag werde ich für 2 Tage nach Enchaluk zum Baikalsee fahren. Der Anlass ist eine Konferenz der Fakultät für Fremdsprachen zur Ehrung einer Jubilarin. Daher packe ich meine Koffer und fahre mit dem Taxi zur Wohnung. Dort packe ich die notwendigen Sachen ein und schreibe Anaida eine SMS : “I think i should come by to say bye”. Nur, dass ich statt nach geplant einer Stunde nach zwei Stunden aufkreuzte. Ich habe ein paar elektronisch Bücher und einen Film (“Dual M for Murder”) mitgebracht. Wir überspielen sie auf Anaidas Laptop. Danach kreieren wir noch ein kurzes “viral video” mit Sascha in der Hauptrolle. Das Videomaterial stammt von dem Seniorenfitnessplatz. Es ist wahrhaftig ein gelungenes Video mit allem Chichi, ach was sage ich: Ein Meisterwerk, das seines gleichen sucht. Anaida lädt es bei vk.com hoch, dem russischen Äquivalent zu Facebook (Der Unterschied ist, dass dort nicht NSA und CIA sondern KGB und FSB die Daten abschnorcheln). Leider bescheidet Sascha die Nachfrage, ob das Video denn bei Youtube hochgeladen werden dürfe, nicht positiv und das Video mit dem Titel “Crazy Buryat” muss wieder gelöscht werden. Sonst würde ich es auch hier dem geneigten Leser stolz darbieten. Ansonsten habe ich mich noch ein wenig an den kleinen Katzenjungen, die Ira interimsmäßig aufgenommen hatte, delektiert. Irgendwann wurde ich dann auch aufgefordert zu gehen und Ira und Anaida begleiteten mich noch ein Stück, wobei wir eine Begegnung eher unerfreulicher Art machten: Ein echter, betrunkene Russe, wie er im Buche steht. Zum Glück war er nicht auf Krawall gebürstet, dennoch ist einem 2 Meter großen Betrunkenen gegenüberzustehen kein Erlebnis, dass man gemacht haben will. Nachdem der Betrunkene von dannen zieht verquatschen wir uns noch etwas und verabschieden uns schließlich.",

        "content": "Heute darf ich an die Uni und eine Vorlesung von einem Harvard Professor besuchen, der als Gastdozent eine Vorlesung über die Arktis und die Antarktis hält. Am Morgen treffe ich Ira und sie führt mich durch die Uni und erklärt mir die verschiedenen Fakultäten. Die Uni ist nicht mit einer deutschen Universität vergleichbar: Die Wände und Fußböden sind schief und überhaupt hat das Gebäude seine besten Tage schon hinter sich. Im Treppenhaus treffen wir zufällig Sascha, der ebenso spontan beschließt seinen Deutschunterricht zu schwänzen. Gegen 9 stößt noch Anaida zur Gruppe hinzu und wir gehen in die Uni-Mensa, die erstaunlich klein ist, aber dafür hervorragendes Essen zubereitet. Mir fällt auf, dass das Besteck aus Aluminium statt aus Edelstahl ist.Diese nette &ldquo;babuschka&rdquo; hat mich als “mein Sohn” und mich gleich darauf als dumm bezeichnetNach dem Essen gehen wir in den großen Vorlesungssaal, um der genannten Vorlesung beizuwohnen. Der Professor erzählt von seinen Tauchgängen in Arktis und Antarktis, jedoch vermochte er nicht wirklich zu fesseln. Möglicherweise lag es daran, dass alles was er erzählte, von einer Englischprofessorin der Universität, teilweise ausgesprochen holprig, übersetzt wurde. Dennoch war es interessant, rechtliche, historische, ökologische und geologische Details über Arktis und Antarktis zu erfahren.Da ist der gute Mann, der laut eigener Aussage immerhin fast einem fleischfressenden Seehund anheimgefallen wäreNach der Vorlesung um 13 Uhr ist Unterrichtsschluss und Anaida schlägt vor, eine Rundfahrt mit der Straßenbahn durch Ulan-Ude zu machen. Wir treffen noch Oyuna und Lisa in einem Park neben der Uni und nehmen dann eine der in meiner Vorstellung rostzerfressenen Straßenbahnen. Auf der Fahrt wird hauptsächlich in Russisch gesprochen, klar: Es wäre schon seltsam, wenn 5 Freunde untereinander Englisch sprechen um auf einen Auswärtigen Rücksicht zu nehmen. Ab und zu erklären Sascha, Oyuna und Anaida etwas, wie z.B. einen Haltestellennamen oder, dass gegenüber die Akademie der Künste zu sehen ist. Wir fahren bis zur Endstation. Anschließend gehen wir an sozialistischen und postsozialistischen Bauten vorbei bis zu einem scheinbaren Spielplatz, der sich jedoch als Sportstätte für Senioren entpuppt, wie ich sie bisher nur aus China kannte. Wir probieren uns an den Geräten.Dann fahren wir wieder in die Innenstadt und gehen zum Zweck der Nahrungsaufnahme in ein Lokal. Dort versuchen sich Oyuna, Anaida, Ira und Sascha daran, mir einige russische Wörter beizubringen. Immerhin behalte ich einigermaßen wie man bis 10 zählt. Ich nehme mir fest vor an der Uni in Deutschland einen Russischkurs zu belegen. Im Anschluss gehen wir in einen Freizeitpark, der - dem Auge nach - noch sozialistischen Zeiten zu entstammen scheint. Als eher risikounfreudiger Mensch sträubt es sich in mir. Ich auf eines dieser Geräte? Ohne deutschen TÜV? Im russischen Buryatien? Schließlich lasse ich mir doch noch gut zureden; auch, weil Oyuna nicht allein auf ein, ich nenne es einmal Erwachsenenkarussel, möchte. Ich setzte mich also dazu und staune nicht schlecht: Trotz des fortgeschrittenen Alters vermochte das Gerät so einiges an Flieh- und Zugkräften zu mobilisieren. Genug um meinen Nerven doch so einige seltsame Zustandssignale zu entlocken, welche schließlich in einem mittellauten Fluchen meinerseits resultierten. Nach der Fahrt steige ich mit einem mulmigen Gefühl wieder auf den Boden, um gleich zu realisieren: Das beste kommt erst noch! Die 30 Jahre alte Schiffsschaukel mit ihrem ausgemergelten Charme und ihrer knochigen Anmut wartet noch. Ich war noch nie auf einer Schiffsschaukel, aber ich erkenne gleich, dass die Schiffsschaukeln, die ich schon mal gesehen habe, nicht - wie es hier der Fall ist - an einem eher streichholzartigen Gerüst hängen. Es kostet mich einiges an Überwindung mich in das teuflische Monstrum zu begeben, gerade, weil Sascha mir mitteilt, dass das gute Stück einen 90-Grad-Winkel erreicht. Ein Irtuum, wie sich später herausstellen sollte, jedoch keiner zu meinen Gunsten. Die neben mir sitzende Oyuna scheint sich der Sache auch nicht mehr so sicher zu sein, was mir unter anderem die gehaltvolle Aussage entlockt “I don&rsquo;t want to die immediatly”. Der abgefuckt dreinblickende Mann, der die unterschiedlichen Gefährte im Park bedient, kommt. Er bedient sie alle, daher muss man immer auf den Mann mit der Sonnenbrille und der Kippe zwischen den Zähnen warten. Als also jener Mann kommt, verkrampfe ich leicht: Jetzt wird es ernst. Es gibt keine Abbruchmöglichkeit. In diesem Moment denke ich nur eines: “Scheiße!“; vielleicht nicht das Wort, aber zum Mindestens die Bedeutung dahinter. Die Elektromotoren fangen an sich zu drehen, die Gummireifen sirren in der Luft und mit jeder Bewegung der Schiffsschaukel erhöht sich der Umkehrpunkt ein wenig. Plötzlich spüre ich die Beschleunigungskräfte und sie werden immer stärker bis zu einem Punkt an dem ich mich so elend fühle, dass mir nichts besseres einfällt als laut “fuck” zu schreien. Ich merke, wie dieser Ausruf etwas befreiendes und auch milderndes hat. Aus diesem Grund bot sich dem Beobachter am Boden in den währenden knapp Sechzig Sekunden ein lautreiches Spektakel: “Fuck!Fuck!Fucking fuck!”. Ich glaube, dass ich noch nie in meinem Leben eine solche Angst hatte. Sogar physische Auswirkungen machen sich bemerkbar. Jedesmal am Totpunkt zittert mein rechtes Bein ohne mein Zutun und ich frage mich wie lange dieser Höllenritt noch dauert. Hinterher erfahre ich, dass die besagte Schiffsschaukel offenbar die 90-Grad-Marke mühelos überwunden hatte und in noch luftigere Höhen aufstieg. Trotz meines Adrenalinpegels, der Charlie Sheens Alkoholpegel an einem Montag mühelos harmlos scheinen lässt, bemerke ich noch, wie am Boden, ob meiner martialischen Verfluchungen, sichtlich Erstaunen herrscht. Jedenfalls, wenn man Mr. “I don&rsquo;t give a fuck” ausnimmt. Er dürfte wahrscheinlich schon Menschen auf den Attraktionen des Parks sterben sehen haben, insofern hat ihn mein mimosenhafter Auftritt sicherlich nicht sonderlich imponiert. Ich frage mich auch, wie Oyuna und Yana, die neben mir saßen, so ruhig bleiben konnten. Kurz vor Ende habe ich auch aufgehört zu schreien. Man sagt ja bekanntlich beim Rettungsschwimmen sind nicht die Menschen ernsthaft in Lebensgefahr, die am lautesten schreien, sondern die, die ganz ruhig sind. Als ich spüre, dass die Schiffsschaukel abgebremst wird bin ich erleichtert wie schon lange nicht mehr. Ich glaube ich hatte noch nie in meinem Leben eine solche Angst und ich war auch noch nie in meinem Leben so erleichtert. Ich freue mich am Leben zu sein und betrete zittrig den festen Boden. Meine Begleiterinnen scheinen die Fahrt auch verkraftet zu haben. Jedenfalls leiern sie gleich einen Photoshoot an, der die folgenden Ergebnisse zeitigt:Ach hätte ich nur die Fotogenität von Sascha!Blick von der HöllenmaschineBlick auf die Höllenmaschine.

        "content": "Am nächsten Tag treffe ich Timur, den ich auch auf Couchsurfing kennengelernt habe. Er ist Englischstudent und spielt in seiner Freizeit “airsoft” oder wie es in Russland genannt wird: “strikeball”. Jeden Samstag treffen sich etwa 10 Spieler um in echten Militäruniformen mit Plastikkügelchen aufeinander zu schießen. Diesen Samstag geht es in den Wald außerhalb der Stadt. Ich habe extra eine Militärhose für 900 Rubel und eine Schutzbrille gekauft. Timur leiht mir seine Automatikwaffe und eine echte deutsche Tarnfleckjacke. Schnell merke ich, dass die Sprachbarriere leider ein Kommunizieren mit den anderen Spielern erschwert. Natürlich kann ich nicht verlangen, dass nicht mehr in Russisch, sondern in Englisch gesprochen wird. Hinzu kommt noch, dass die meisten kein Englisch sprechen. So stehe ich in den Pausen zwischen den Spielen eher Nichts tuend herum und beschränke mich auf Essen und Ausrüstung modifizieren. Aber im Spiel selber beschränkt sich die Kommunikation sowieso auf ein Minimum und es ist wahrhaftig spannend. Gleichzeitig muss ich auch daran denken, ob sich Soldaten, die mit scharfer Munition schießen, ähnlich fühlen. Ich versuche mir vorzustellen, wie es wäre, wenn ein Treffer tödlich wäre, kann es aber nicht. Zur Armee zu gehen ist die größte Eselei, die man begehen kann, um einen gewissen Radiomoderator zu zitieren. Das Spiel geht etwa 5 Stunden, unterbrochen von Pausen, und endet schließlich um 3, am Nachmittag. Die Spielvarianten nannten sich “free fall” (Jeder gegen jeden), “capture the flag” (es gilt einen orangen Kanister zu ergattern und in das gegnerische Camp zu transportieren) und “team deathmatch” (Team A vs. Team B, in diesem Fall Nato vs. russische Armee).Die Spieler in russischen ArmeeunformenDas Lagerfeuer über dem gekocht wurdeNach dem Spiel holt mich Yana ab und wir fahren zur WG in der Anaida lebt, dort lerne ich noch die Biologiestudentin Irina aka. Ira und die Englischstudentin Oyuna, die die personifizierte Euphorie zu seien scheint, kennen. Die Mädchen bringen mir russische, vulgäre Wörter bei. Von “hui” bis “sutschka” oder auch “siskii” ist alles dabei. Gut zu wissen! Spontan beschließen die Mädels, dass sie eine Art Willkommensparty schmeissen wollen. Anaida schlägt vor Sascha und eine weitere Freundin - Lisa - einzuladen. Ich erfahre noch, dass in Russland nach 21 Uhr kein Wodka verkauft werden darf und, dass man in Russland Wodka nur ab dem 21 Lebensjahr kaufen darf. Schlussendlich fahren wir alle zu Yanas Wohnung und ich komme in den Genuss einer russischen Taxifahrt. Der Fahrer prügelt den verrosteten Lada über die unebenen Straßen der Stadt bis in den äußeren Stadtrand, als ginge es um Leben und Tod. Wir schauen gemeinsam etwa 10 Minuten “Oblivion”, bis Oyuna und Lisa, die den Bus genommen haben, auch ankommen. Nun beginnt das russische Trinkgelage: Oyuna füllt ein Schnappsglas mit Wodka und ein Weinglas mit Saft für Jeden und erklärt, dass man in Russland nicht Wodka-O oder ähnliches mischt, sondern sich den puren Wodka hinter die Binde kippt und danach den Saft trinkt. Nach einer kleinen Ansprache heißt es Trinken! Nach der nächsten Runde darf auch ich einen Trinkspruch aufsagen, ich sage, dass ich froh bin Russland kennenzulernen und verliere den Faden. Mir fällt nichts besseres ein, als mit der Losung “Let&rsquo;s drink to life” zu enden. Nach etwa 4-5 Runden steigen ich und die Mehrheit aus, nur Oyuna und Sascha, die sich - fast klischeehaft - als trinkfest erweisen, gehen noch eine Runde weiter. Ich schlage vor Durak zu spielen und präsentiere mein Kartenset, dass ich meisten mit mir führe. Wir spielen einige Runden und ich beginne endlich die Regeln zu verstehen.Hier lässt sich womöglich erkennen, warum ich an diesem Abend gelernt habe, das &ldquo;krasnaja&rdquo; Rot auf Russisch heißt.",

        "content": "Zeitsprung: Donnerstag 12. September 12 Uhr. Ich sitze in meinem Zimmer und versuche mir verzweifelt ein Thema auszudenken. Nach vielen Missschlägen, sehe ich auf die Uhr und beginne zu realisieren, dass mir nichts außergewöhnliches einfallen wird. Also beschließe ich, für den Fall, dass die Frage-Antwort-Stunde nicht trägt eine Bundestagsrede von Gregor Gysi zu zeigen und auf dieser Basis über Politikersprache zu sprechen. Also packe ich mein MacBook in die Tasche und sehe einmal mehr auf die Uhr, mit dem Ergebnis, dass mich eine Panikwelle erfasst: 15 Minuten vor 13 Uhr! Ich haste notgedrungen aus der Wohnung in Richtung Innenstadt, wo die Deutschfakultät angesiedelt ist. Grade noch pünktlich angekommen werde ich auch schon von  der studentischen Hilfskraft Victoria in den Raum gebeten, wo ich mein Seminar halten soll. Doch oh weh, um welchen Preis habe ich die Pünktlichkeit eingehalten, ich merke wie mir die Schweißtropfen von der Stirn rinnen. In der Hoffnung, dass es wenigstens nicht allzu viele Studenten sind, betrete ich erwartungsvoll den Raum. Doch dieser ist komplett gefüllt. Ich habe noch nie vor so vielen Menschen gesprochen, bin nicht im klassischen Sinne vorbereitet und bin grade 15 Minuten zur Uni gesprintet. Wenigstens wird meiner Bitte um ein Wasser genüge getan, sodass ich wenigstens nicht dehydriere. Ich blicke in schätzungsweise 30 neugierige, einige apathische und sehr wenige antipathische Augenpaare (zumindest behaupte ich das einfach mal im Nachhinein, weil es spannender klingt).Ich beginne mit einer Begrüßung, schreibe meinen Namen an die Tafel, erzähle etwas über mich und rede ab da an ohne Unterlass und Ziel. Zuerst spreche ich Deutsch, als ich erfahre, dass viele Studenten Englischstudenten sind spreche ich in Englisch weiter. Doch nach 5 Minuten erklärt mir Victoria, dass ich besser in Deutsch weitersprechen sollte, da die Studenten einen deutschen Muttersprachler hören sollen. Ich habe zwar den begründeten Verdacht, dass Deutsch deutlich schlechter verstanden wird, aber ich befolge die Bitte selbstverständlich. Ich stelle Fragen an die Gruppe, was natürlich immer schwer ist, wenn sich konkret nur selten Studenten angesprochen fühlen. Aber immerhin antworten vereinzelt Studenten (meist sind es dieselben, wie man es aus der Schule kennt) und stellen auch Fragen wie: &ldquo;Wo lebst du?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Was ist der Unterschied zwischen Russland und Deutschland?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wie ist es für dich hier zu stehen?&rdquo; (Ja, das ist eindeutig eine Metafrage), &ldquo;Wie lange bleibst du in Ulan-Ude&rdquo;, &ldquo;Was sind deine Hobbys?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Was hast du hier vor?&rdquo; usw.. Diese Fragen habe ich alle nach bestem Wissen und Gewissen beflissen abgearbeitet, es wurde sogar kurz pathetisch als ich auf die Frage &ldquo;Warum studierst du Physik?&rdquo; antworte: &ldquo;Ich möchte die Welt und das Universum verstehen und ich denke Physik hilft dabei.&rdquo;. Dass ich gleich darauf frage: “Und warum studiert ihr Deutsch?” war sicher auch missverständlich aufgefasst etwas ostentativ. Ansonsten habe ich den Studenten noch das Bachelorsystem mit seiner Modularisierung erklärt und dabei erfahren, dass das Studium an der buryatischen Universität stärker verschult ist, auch wenn dies bereits oft und lautstark an den deutschen Unis beklagt wird. Im ersten Jahr müssen die Studenten verpflichtend Fächer, wie Philosophie, Mathematik, Geschichte und mehr besuchen, aber die Studenten beginnen auch in der Regel das Studium schon mit 17. Ich hätte zu gerne eine Aufnahme meiner mehr unter Improvisationsperformance zu rubrizierende Vorstellung gesehen um mir einen Eindruck davon verschaffen zu können. Immerhin schrieb eine Studentin später in einer Mail “Thank you for your class, it was very interesting and informative.”, was natürlich auch einem Mitleidsbonus zuzuschreiben sein könnte, da ich an dem Anschließen meines MacBooks an den Beamer ungefähr 10 Minuten gescheitert bin und anschließend bin ich gleich noch einmal 10 Minuten daran gescheitert den Computer im Raum dazu zu bringen auf Bundestag.de das genannte Gysi-Video abzuspielen. Daher blieb es für den Rest der Stunde beim Frage-Antwort-Format. Dazu kann ich noch anfügen, dass nachher ein Student, namens Sascha, meinte, dass er froh gewesen sei, dass ich das Video nicht zeigen konnte, da er Politik langweilig finde. Am Ende der Stunde bin ich froh und ein wenig stolz, dass ich doch zum Mindesten die Mehrheit der Studenten zu einem gewissen Grad belustigen konnte. Irgendwie tut es mir auch leid, als ich erfahre, dass die meisten Studenten trotz Unterrichtsschluss dageblieben sind um mein “Seminar” zu besuchen.Nach der Stunde kommen dann noch ein paar Studentinnen zu mir um meine Telefonnummer zu erfragen, welche ich natürlich nicht zurückhalte. Auch ein Foto wollen die Studentinnen - und ich merke wieder einmal mehr, dass ich den Begriff Fotogenität nur geringfügig mit Leben fülle.Nein, diese Bilder enstanden nicht kurz nachdem ich erfahren habe, dass mein Hamster gestorben ist. Schließlich gehe ich mit Nastya und Sascha in ein Lokal nahe der Uni. Dort ruft mich dann plötzlich und aus heiterem Himmel Anaida, die ich bei Couchsurfing.org angeschrieben habe, an und sagt sie würde in einer Viertelstunde mit ihrer Freundin Yana, bei der ich unterkommen kann, vorbeikommen. Nach einem kurzen Kennenlernen fahren wir zusammen mit Sascha zu der mit dem Bus 20 Minuten von der Innenstadt gelegen Wohnung Yanas. Ihre Eltern haben ihr eine der Wohnungen in einem ganz neuem Häuserblock gekauft. Die Wohnung ist nagelneu, dennoch sind bereits leichte Risse an den Wänden und Decken zu sehen. Dies ist dem Umstand zu schulden, dass neuen Häuser allesamt von Chinesen gebaut werden, wie ich später erfahren sollte. Wir essen etwas in der Wohnung reden ein wenig, wobei ich doch noch etwas umentspannt bin, was ich daran festmachen kann, dass ich im Gespräch mit Anaida - zum Kennenlernen - völlig absurde Fragen, wie: “Gibt es hier in der Nähe Ärzte” stelle. Nach ein wenig mehr Unterhaltung, gehen Anaida und Sascha und ich darf es mir auf einer Decke auf dem Boden gemütlich machen. Auch wenn es Couchsurfing heißt, gibt&rsquo;s nicht immer eine Couch.Blick aus der Wohnung Yanas",

Dazu musste ich an der Universität zur Abteilung für internationale Angelegenheiten um mich bei der Meldebehörde registrieren zu lassen. Angekommen fiel mir dann auf, dass ich eine Kleinigkeit vergessen hatte: Meinen Reisepass. Doch zum Glück lag er nur in der Wohnung. Nachdem ich den Bürokraten genug Papier zum Abstempeln gegeben hatte, half mir Nastya, die nette Sekretärin der Deutschfakultät, beim Kauf einer russischen SIM-Karte für mein Nexus 4. Sie war 20 und eine Deutschstudentin. So gab es keinerlei Sprachbarriere, weshalb ich problemlos erfuhr, dass sie Lehrerin werden will und sogar schon einmal in Deutschland, genauer gesagt: in Bochum, war. Der Kauf gestalte sich unkompliziert. Eine Prepaidkarte mit 3 Gigabyte Inklusivvolumen, 100 SMS und ungefähr 100 Freiminuten kostete lediglich 300 Rubel, was etwa 8€ entspricht. Da fragt man sich schon, was die Telekom in Deutschland eigentlich falsch macht. Kaum macht man&rsquo;s mal richtig, da klappt&rsquo;s auch schon. Wie auch immer. Jedenfalls habe ich noch von Nastya erfahren, dass sie eine Deutsche kennt, die seit 2 Wochen in Ulan-Ude ist. Sie ist eine Berlinerin, die für ein Jahr als Au-Pair in Ulan-Ude sein wird und Nastya wollte ein Treffen arrangieren. Lustigerweise kannte ich ihre Au-Pair-Vorgängerin Pia, die bei der selben Familie als Au-Pair war, weil sie ihre Erlebnisse in Ulan-Ude unter http://russischbrot.blogspot.de verbloggt hat. Ich war vor der Reise zufällig über Google auf das Blog gestoßen. Nastya kannte Pia auch und sogar persönlich - die weite Welt kann so klein sein. Dann wurde mir an der Fakultät noch mitgeteilt, welche Termine ich zu beachten hatte: unter anderem ein Seminar, dass ich am nächsten Tag um 13 Uhr geben sollte. Mir wurde gesagt es würde nur ein ungezwungenes Gespräch mit ein paar Studenten von der Fakultät werden. ",

        "content": "Ich beginne heute am 19.09.2013 mit der Niederschrift meiner Erlebnisse in Ulan-Ude, Russland. Ich bin nun seit 9 Tagen in Ulan-Ude und jetzt gerade am Baikalsee, in Enchaluk, daher habe ich Zeit totzuschlagen. Warum also nicht mit Schreiben? Ich habe noch etwa 12 Tage vor mir, bis ich wieder nach Deutschland zurück muss. Insgesamt kann ich bereits sagen, dass ich definitiv wieder nach Ulan-Ude kommen möchte, möglicherweise im nächsten Jahr. Zudem möchte ich umbedingt Russisch lernen und zwar so, dass ich im Alltag mit den Muttersprachen einigermaßen mithalten kann. Alles begann am 10.09.2013 im beschaulichen Witten. Um etwa 4 Uhr morgens wurde ich, da ich meinen Koffer wortwörtlich am letzten Tag gepackt habe, nach leider nur etwa 2 Stunden Schlaf geweckt und musste mich zum Bahnhof begeben. Ich bin selber überrascht, dass mir das Gepackte tatsächlich gereicht hat - gut, dazu muss der Vollständigkeit halber noch gesagt werden, dass ich meine Jacke vergessen hatte. Ohne Jacke nach Russland? Im Herbst? Das ist nun einmal der Nachteil einer ad-hoc Reisevorbereitung.Zum Flug gibt es nichts besonderes zu sagen. Die Verbindung ging von Düsseldorf nach Moskau Sheremetyevo (Leider kein Edward Snowden!) und nach nur 6 Stunden Wartezeit ging es auch hernach mit S7 Airlines nach Ulan-Ude, der - 500.000 Einwohner zählenden - Hauptstadt der autonomen Republik Buryatien. Aufgrund von Nebel auf der Landebahn zog die, recht betagte, sicher um die 20 Jahre alte Boeing 767 für eine Stunde Kreise über der Stadt, bis sie endlich zur Landung ansetzte.Die Location-History des MonatsAngekommen, wurden wir von dem Leiter der Deutschfakultät der staatlichen Universität Buryatien und dessen Stellvertreterin in Empfang genommen und zu unserer Wohnung gebracht, wo wir den Resttag verbrachten. Etwa 15 Minuten Fußweg von der Innenstadt entfernt und für rund 15.000 Rubel, bot sie den Charme, den ein Wohnblock aus Sovietzeiten nun einmal verströmt. Auch die Einrichtung setzte sich, bis auf den vergleichsweise modernen Röhrenfernseher, aus Rudimenten der Zeit des Kommunismus zusammen. Die Wohnung gehörte vermutlich einem älteren Paar, dass sich mit der Vermietung noch ein paar Rubel unter der Hand verdienen wollte.Nein, hierbei handelt es sich nicht um ein makaberes Ausstellungsstück zum Thema Uwe Barschel, sondern um die Wasserqualität an einem MontagAuch sonst finden sich in der Stadt, mit dem größten Leninkopf der Welt, noch viele Anachronismen, wie etwa die hochbetagten Straßenbahnen, die seit Dekaden unermüdlich im Betrieb sind. Auch das Bussystem ist bemerkenswert, es gibt keine staatlichen Busse, sondern Kleinbusse die im Privatbesitz sind, aber feste Routen, wie deutsche Buslinien im ÖPNV, fahren. Der Vorteil ist, dass man nie lange auf den Bus warten muss; der Nachteil ist natürlich eine gewisse Ineffizienz. Der russische Name der Kleinbusse lautet “Marschutka”. ",

Weltkrieg in Deutschland etwas näher und gibt Aufschluss über Deutschlands Wirtschaftswunder. Da im Rahmen der Depublikation staatlich angeordneten Kulturvernichtung die Doku aus der ARD-Mediathek depupliziert getilgt wurde gibt es die Doku nur auf Youtube zu sehen:Insgesamt ist es doch erstaunlich, wie sich diese falschen Vorstellungen in das kollektive Gedächtnis eingebrannt haben. Auch der Geschichtsunterricht in der Schule war hier anscheinend in den meisten Punkten kein ausreichendes Korrektiv.Die wesentlichen Punkte des Dokumentarfilms waren:Fleiß der Deutschen - Waren die Deutschen fleißiger als ihre Nachbarn?Die Jahresarbeitszeiten in Deutschland waren nicht höher als in anderen europäischen Ländern und starkes Wirtschaftswachstum gab es auch in vielen anderen europäischen Ländern.Deutschland lag nach dem Krieg vollkommen in Trümmern - War das auch abseits der Wochenschauen so?Deutschland wurde nicht flächendeckend zerbombt, wie oftmals behauptet wird. Eine von der Airforce in Auftrag gegebene Analyse der Schäden durch Bombardements ergab, dass die meisten  Ziele verfehlt wurden. Der Anlagenpark der deutschen Industrie war nach dem 2. Weltkrieg größer als zuvor.Der Wohlstand kam zu einem großen Teil durch die Währungsreform, also die D-Mark, welche von Ludwig Erhard eingeführt wurdeDer Plan der Währungsreform wurde von den Amerikanern entwickelt (Festlegung der Wechselkurse &amp; Herstellung des ersten Geldes und mehr&hellip;) und beschlossen ohne erwähnenswertes Zutun Erhards.Der Marshall-PlanDie Motivation war die schlichte Überlegung, dass nur der ökonomische Erfolg Europa davor abhalten konnte kommunistisch zu werden. Zudem war der Marshall-Plan nicht für das deutsche Wirtschaftswunder relevant. Viel mehr trugen die vielen Flüchtlinge und Vertriebenen aus dem Osten (Braindrain) zum Aufschwung bei.Der Koreakrieg ließ den deutschen Export explosiv ansteigen. Deutschland exportiert Stahl und Maschinen zum Bau von Waffen, Panzern und Bomben.Deutschland setzte sich mit höchster Qualität an die Spitze des AutomobilbausektorsDie deutsche Autofertigung war am Anfang größtenteils eine Kopie der amerikanischen Fließbandfertigung und setzte auf billig statt Qualität. Teilweise kamen erste Fertigungsstraßen zu 100 Prozent aus Amerika.Deutschlands erlassener SchuldenbergDeutschland hatte einen riesigen Schuldenberg. Auf der Londoner Schuldenkonferenz 1953 wird Deutschland die Hälfte seiner Schulden erlassen. Dort beschlossen alle europäischen Länder zusätzlich auf Reparationsansprüche zu verzichten. Die Amerikaner stellten die entscheidenden Weichen, aus Angst vor einem Übergreifen des Kommunismus auf Westdeutschland. Wenn heute Griechen ihre Schulden nicht begleichen, wäre man sozusagen quitt.Geschichte der Rosenthal-AG1935 wurde die Rosenthal-AG, die einer jüdischen Familie gehörte “arisiert”. Die Familie floh daraufhin und bemühte sich nach dem 2. Weltkrieg um die Rückgabe der Firma. Die Ariseure, die nun im Aufsichtsrat saßen, bemühten sich, die Rückgabe zu konterkarieren. Ausgerechnet Ludwig Erhard schrieb einen Brief an die Militärregierung, in dem er sich dafür einsetzte, die Rückgabe der Firma Rosenthal zu verhindern. Das Ganze macht das Detail, dass Erhard einen profitablen Beratervertrag mit der Firma Rosenthal hatte, noch einmal liederlicher. Erhard wird daher auch in CIA-Akten als bestechlich eingestuft.",

Nach  dem Scheitern eines Versuchs, entwickelt der frustrierte Kogler Eigeninitiative und bewirbt sich bei einem Bestatter und fängt dort seine Ausbildung an. Im weiteren Verlauf des Films wird die Entwicklung von Kogler und dessen Integration in die Gesellschaft nacherzählt. Das Schöne dabei ist, dass es sich in keinster Weise um eine abgeschmackte &ldquo;vom Underdog zum Helden&rdquo;-Geschichte handelt, wie man sie schon in unendlichen Hollywoodstreifen zu Gesicht bekommen hat. Nein, dieser Film erzählt die Geschichte von einfachen Menschen und zeigt sehr reale Lebenswelten, die mit wenigen Ausnahmen, nicht überzeichnet sind, sondern stets authentisch bleiben. Auch der weitestgehende Verzicht auf eine musikalische Untermalung gibt “Atmen” einen dokumentarischen Charakter. Diese Authentizität verleiht dem Ganzen einen besonderen Reiz. Als Zuschauer wird man so zum Voyeur und blickt in ein anderes, wahrhaftiges Leben und nicht etwa in eine Erzählung, die nur ausmalt wie ein anderes Leben seien könnte.Zudem konfrontiert der Film den Zuschauer mit dem unangenehmmen Thema Tod in einer bedrückender Weise, die jedoch niemals erdrückend wird, da aufwühlende Bilder, wie die von nackten Leichen, wie im echten Leben eines Bestatters auch, nur kurze Momente, in einem Alltag eingebettet, sind. Markovics imposante Bildkomposition ist ebenfalls ein markantes Merkmal dieses Films. Die Einfachheit der Motive und Markovics zielsicherer Sinn für Ästhetik, wie ich ihn, persönlich, bisher nur von Stanley Kubrick kannte, bescheren dem Betrachter einen Strom an kraftvollen Bildern, deren Klarheit ein Erlebnis für sich sind.Bemerkenswert ist auch, dass die Hauprollrolle Roman Kogler nicht etwa, von einem ausgebildeten Schauspieler gespielt wird, sondern von dem, aus 300 Bewerbern gecasteten, Laiendarsteller Thomas Schubert, welcher nicht nur das tatsächliche Alter seiner Rolle hat, sondern auch keine schauspielerische Techniken, abgesehen von Basiskenntnissen in Atmung und Mimik, gelernt hat. Thomas Schubert  füllt seine Rolle voll aus und schafft es einen plastischen und lebendigen Charakter auf die Leinwand zu bringen. Auch zu erwähnen ist, dass “Atmen” der Erstlingsfilm von Karl Markovics ist, der mit diesem Film hinter die Kamera gewechselt ist und somit als Regisseur debütiert.Fazit: Anfängliche Skepsis, ob der Film nicht ein trockener und vollkommen düsterer Art-House-Film, der Sorte, die auf eine kleine Nische hart-gesottener Kunst-Fetischisten abzielt, ist, muss als absolut Falsch bezeichnet werden. “Atmen” erfüllt solche Befürchtungen nicht und hat seine Legion an Preisen völlig zurecht erhalten. Der Film bietet letztendlich ein hervorragend erzähltes Drama, welches auch den Wiener Schmäh nicht missen lässt. Daher und auf Grund der beeindruckenden Bildsprache, die die 90 Minuten im Kino, wie im Fluge vergehen lässt, kann ich für diesen Film eine klare Empfehlung aussprechen; zumindest für Jeden, der einen Weg abseits der abgetretenen Pfade Hollywoods betreten und sich ein wenig herausfordern möchte. Auch wenn nicht alles, was hinkt ein Vergleich ist: Dieser Film ist quasi Drive, nur noch lebensnaher.",

        "content": "Revision 1: Dec. 2, 1987 by Joe TalmadgeIn the time I have been posting to net, I have encountered flame wars of epic proportions (Brahms Gang vs. Tim Maroney), and flame wars of a more modest nature (MIT vs. CIT). Flaming has evolved into a highly-stylized art form, complete with unwritten rules and guidelines.Here, I have attempted to document the Art of Flaming, in such a way as it will be interesting to old hands (flame masters) and novices (virgins) alike. Without a further ado, then, I present:The twelve commandments of flamingMake things up about your opponent: It&rsquo;s important to make your lies sound true. Preface your argument with the word &ldquo;clearly.&rdquo; &ldquo;Clearly, Fred Flooney is a liar, and a dirtball to boot.&rdquo;Be an armchair psychologist: You&rsquo;re a smart person. You&rsquo;ve heard of Freud. You took a psychology course in college. Clearly, you&rsquo;re qualified to psychoanalyze your opponent. &ldquo;Polly Purebread, by using the word &lsquo;zucchini&rsquo; in her posting, shows she has a bad case of penis envy.&rdquo;Cross-post your flames: Everyone on the net is just waiting for the next literary masterpiece to leave your terminal. From rec.arts.wobegon to alt.gourmand, they&rsquo;re all holding their breaths until your next flame. Therefore, post everywhere.Conspiracies abound: If everyone&rsquo;s against you, the reason can&rsquo;t possiblybe that you&rsquo;re a fuckhead. There&rsquo;s obviously a conspiracy against you, and you will be doing the entire net a favor by exposing it.Lawsuit threats: This is the reverse of Rule #4 (sort of like the Yin &amp; Yang of flaming). Threatening a lawsuit is always considered to be in good form. &ldquo;By saying that I&rsquo;ve posted to the wrong group, Bertha has libeled me, slandered me, and sodomized me. See you in court, Bertha.&rdquo;Force them to document their claims: Even if Harry Hoinkus states outright that he likes tomato sauce on his pasta, you should demand documentation. If Newsweek hasn&rsquo;t written an article on Harry&rsquo;s pasta preferences, then Harry&rsquo;s obviously lying.Use foreign phrases: French is good, but Latin is the lingua franca of flaming. You should use the words &ldquo;ad hominem&rdquo; at least three times per article. Other favorite Latin phrases are &ldquo;ad nauseum,&rdquo; &ldquo;vini, vidi, vici,&rdquo; and &ldquo;fetuccini alfredo.&rdquo;Tell 'em how smart you are: Why use intelligent arguments to convince them you&rsquo;re smart when all you have to do is tell them? State that you&rsquo;re a member of Mensa or Mega or Dorks of America. Tell them the scores you received on every exam since high school. &ldquo;I got an 800 on my SATs, LSATs, GREs, MCATs, and I can also spell the word 'premeiotic&rsquo; .&rdquo;Accuse your opponent of censorship. It is your right as an American citizen to post whatever the hell you want to the net (as guaranteed by the 37th Amendment, I think). Anyone who tries to limit your cross-posting or move a flame war to email is either a communist, a fascist, or both.Doubt their existence: You&rsquo;ve never actually seen your opponent, have you? And since you&rsquo;re the center of the universe, you should have seen them by now, shouldn&rsquo;t you? Therefore, THEY DON&rsquo;T EXIST! This is the beauty of flamers&rsquo; logic.Lie, cheat, steal, leave the toilet seat up.When in doubt, insult: If you forget the other 11 rules, remember this one. At some point during your wonderful career as a flamer you will undoubtedly end up in a flame war with someone who is better than you. This person will expose your lies, tear apart your arguments, make you look generally like a bozo. At this point, there&rsquo;s only one thing to do: insult the dirtbag!!! &ldquo;Oh yeah? Well, your mother does strange things with vegetables.&rdquo;The Golden Rule of FlamingMy flames will be witty, insulting, interesting, funny, caustic, or sarcastic, but never, ever, will they be boring.Here endeth the scriptures. - Quelle: Uncyclopedia - Flame Wars &amp; funny.net",

        "content": "Zuerst einmal etwas allgemeines zu meiner Vorliebe für amerikanische und britische Fernsehproduktionen: Übermäßiger Fernsehkonsum wird ja gerne mit dem Bild der in die Kneipe gehenden Eltern in Verbindung gebracht, wo in so einem Fall zuhause dann Spongebob auf die Kleinen aufpasst. Auch wenn es in meinem Fall nicht so schlimm war, ist es zumindest so, dass mir, wenn man so will, Spongebob Englisch gelehrt hat.Im Nachhinein kommt es mir selbst wie reiner Wahnsinn vor, dennoch muss ich nach 9 Jahren Englischunttericht (seit der 3. Klasse in der Grundschule) konstatieren, dass mich englischsprachige Serien und Filme besser und schneller mit einem profunden Englischwortschatz ausgestattet haben als 9! Jahre Unterricht im Bildungssystem dieses Landes. Und nicht nur das, nein auch Einblicke in die amerikanische und britische Kultur und das dortige Selbstverständnis waren Dinge die zwar auf dem Lehrplan standen, aber niemals im Unterricht intuitiv und enthusiasmierend (ok ok, klingt abgebrochen, aber ich wollte das Wort schon immer einmal verwenden) vermittelt werden konnten.Gerade wenn man heutige Politikergenerationen mit noch teilweise dürftigen Englischkenntnissen betrachtet, so muss einem klar werden, dass die Schule in punkto Sprachvermittlung einen echt dürftigen Beitrag leistet. Ich stelle fest, dass im Internetzeitalter (Steinzeit, Bronzezeit, Internetzeit?) viel mehr Schüler viel besser und effizienter Englisch lernen als jemals zuvor. Ich kenne ziemlich viele, die sich hauptsächlich englischsprachige Filme und Serien ansehen und in der Folge ganz natürlich die Sprache lernen.Ich gehe sogar so weit, zu sagen schreiben, dass es Teil des Schulsystems sein müsste, den Schülern Zugang zu zumindestens englischsprachigen Serien und Filmen zu geben. Und jeder sollte auch Zugang zu einem Smartphone mit einem Englischwörterbuch erhalten. Wer schlägt denn ernsthaft noch in einem 500-seitigen Schinken nach wenn er gerade mal ein Wort in einem Buch, einem Film etc. nicht versteht? Ich schätze mich glücklich, da ich all solche Dinge habe, aber so etwas sollte eine Selbstverständlichkeit sein, die offen für alle Schüler ist.Auch ich hatte nicht das Geld mir jede Serie und jeden Film auf Plastikscheiben aus einem Laden oder über das Netz zu kaufen. Ich habe mir ausgeholfen indem ich mich zuvorderst der Piratenbucht und diversen Filehostern bedient habe. Bildung dank Raubkopierern? Tja, wer hätte das gedacht. Mich würde es nicht wundern, wenn diese Entwicklungen tatsächlich die Gesellschaft positiv beeinflusst, hin zu mehr Kosmopolitismus. Warum diese Entwicklung nicht Eingang in die Bildungspolitik findet ist mir ein Mysterium.Statt die Chancen zu sehen wird nur gesehen, dass sich eine Kostenloskultur verbreite. Wieso eigentlich nicht? Wie sähe denn eine Kostenloskultur aus? Man stelle sich das einmal vor: Jeder Schüler einer weiterführenden Schule erhält jeden Monat einen Gutschein über 100€ für englischsprachige Serien, Filme und Bücher. Und beim lernen jeder anderen Sprache gibt es noch einmal einen entsprechenden Gutschein. Weitergedacht wäre mit dieser Kostenloskultur nicht viel mehr eine Insel der Seeligen geschaffen als der Untergang des Kulturbetriebs? Zumal es die Neugier für anderes fördert und eine all zu sehr an eine Monokultur erinnernde Einengung des Medienkonsums auf Deutsches vermeidet.In vielen kleinen skandinavischen Ländern in denen es keine Synchronfassungen von Filmen und Serien gibt, sind die Schüler nachweislich sprachlich den deutschen Schülern eklatant überlegen.Ich will, dass die Kostenloskultur endlich Realität wird! Irgendwann muss die Evidenz doch auch die verkrustetesten Strukturen zur Anerkennung der Realität führen, welche da lautet: Fremdsprachenunterricht ist, so wie er sich heute an den allermeisten Schulen gestaltet, selten wirklich sinnhaltig. Das heißt, kostenlose Kultur durch (hinreichende) Kostenloskultur. In diesem Sinne: Sharing is caring.Quelle: fanpop",
