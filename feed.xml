<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Between 9 PM and 5 AM, my internet usage is basically 95% garbage. Social media, YouTube rabbit holes, Reddit arguments with strangers – you know the drill. The thing is, I <em>know</em> this while I’m doing it. But somehow at 1 AM my brain goes “yeah but what if there’s one more interesting thread” and before I know it the birds are chirping outside.</p>

<p>What I wanted was simple:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Block internet at night (no exceptions button I can just click)</li>
  <li>Force myself to explain <em>why</em> I need access</li>
  <li>Have something more objective than my 1 AM brain decide if that’s legit</li>
  <li>Time limits so I can’t abuse a single approval for hours</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h2>

<p>I grabbed a <a href="https://aliexpress.com/item/1005008375955032.html">GL.iNet GL-MT3000 (Beryl AX)</a> travel router for about 60 Euro. It runs OpenWrt, has enough storage for Python, and sits between all my devices and the actual internet. This is important – there’s no way to bypass it without physically unplugging it (and at that point, if I’m that desperate, maybe I deserve the internet).</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>When I connect to WiFi after 9 PM, instead of getting internet I get a chat interface. An AI (Google’s Gemini) asks me why I need access. The conversation goes something like:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2026-02-19-llm-gatekeeper-router_chat.png" alt="Nighttime Access Request chat interface" /></p>

<p><strong>AI</strong>: “It’s 11:30 PM. Why do you need internet access?”</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: “I need to check email.”</p>

<p><strong>AI</strong>: “How many minutes do you need?”</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: “30 minutes.”</p>

<p><strong>AI</strong>: “Why specifically 30 minutes? What will you be doing?”</p>

<p>And here’s the thing – having to actually type out “I want to mindlessly scroll Twitter” makes you realize how stupid that sounds. Half the time I just give up and go to bed instead. Which is exactly the point.</p>

<p>The AI grants different amounts of time based on what you need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>10 minutes for quick checks</li>
  <li>Up to 60 minutes for actual work due TODAY</li>
  <li>Up to 120 minutes for video calls</li>
</ul>

<p>For anything over 10 minutes, it wants proof. Screenshot of that urgent email? Calendar invite for that meeting? Upload it. The AI actually looks at the image and checks if it matches what you claimed. No more “I have work stuff” as a universal excuse.</p>

<h2 id="the-technical-bits">The Technical Bits</h2>

<p>If you care about the implementation (if not, skip to the Claude Code section):</p>

<p>The whole thing is a Python script running on the router. It does DNS hijacking so all domains point to the router, then redirects HTTP traffic to a captive portal page. When you’re chatting with the AI, your messages go to Google’s Gemini API. If approved, it adds iptables rules to let your specific device through for the approved duration.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># All DNS queries resolve to router</span>
uci add_list dhcp.@dnsmasq[0].address<span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'/#/192.168.8.1'</span>

<span class="c"># All HTTP goes to captive portal</span>
iptables <span class="nt">-t</span> nat <span class="nt">-I</span> PREROUTING 1 <span class="nt">-i</span> br-lan <span class="nt">-p</span> tcp <span class="nt">--dport</span> 80 <span class="nt">-j</span> REDIRECT <span class="nt">--to-port</span> 2050

<span class="c"># Block actual internet access</span>
iptables <span class="nt">-t</span> filter <span class="nt">-I</span> FORWARD 1 <span class="nt">-i</span> br-lan <span class="nt">-o</span> eth0 <span class="nt">-j</span> REJECT
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The system also keeps a log of all my requests throughout the night. So if I’ve already asked three times, the AI gets more skeptical. “You already got approved twice tonight, why do you need more time?” It’s like having a disappointed parent watching over your shoulder.</p>

<p>Cron jobs handle the scheduling – gatekeeper mode enables at 9 PM, disables at 5 AM. Even rebooting the router at midnight doesn’t help, it comes back up in restricted mode.</p>

<h2 id="built-with-claude-code-in-one-evening">Built with Claude Code in One Evening</h2>

<p>Here’s the part that blows my mind: I built this entire thing in a single evening using Claude Code. Normally a project like this would involve days of reading OpenWrt docs, fighting with iptables syntax, debugging why the captive portal won’t show up, etc. Instead I just told Claude what I wanted and it SSHed into the router, figured out the constraints, and wrote the code.</p>

<p>The workflow was basically:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Me: “I want an AI-gated internet system on this router”</li>
  <li>Claude: <em>checks router specs, proposes architecture</em></li>
  <li>Me: “The captive portal isn’t showing”</li>
  <li>Claude: <em>debugs iptables, finds issue, fixes it</em></li>
  <li>Me: “Now add image proof for longer requests”</li>
  <li>Claude: <em>adds file upload, integrates multimodal API</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Each iteration took minutes. I steered, Claude implemented.</p>

<h2 id="where-claude-code-screwed-up">Where Claude Code Screwed Up</h2>

<p>Let me be clear though – it wasn’t magic. Some real bugs I had to catch:</p>

<p><strong>Bug 1</strong>: After setting up DNS hijacking (all domains → router IP), the captive portal showed the router’s admin UI instead of my splash page. Claude had excluded the router IP from the redirect, but with DNS hijacking <em>everything</em> pointed to the router IP, so nothing got redirected. I had to point out the wrong page was showing before Claude figured it out.</p>

<p><strong>Bug 2</strong>: The AI couldn’t reach Google’s servers because… my own DNS hijacking was hijacking the API hostname too. Claude first tried hardcoding the IP (broke SSL). Eventually got a proper fix: resolve via external DNS, then monkey-patch Python’s socket handling. Took a few iterations.</p>

<p>The pattern: Claude optimized for the immediate problem without seeing how it’d interact with other parts. Classic AI coding issue. The workflow that actually works is AI implements, human validates. I couldn’t have built this in an evening alone, but Claude couldn’t have shipped it without me catching these bugs. We’re in the centaur phase of AI coding.</p>

<h2 id="does-it-actually-work">Does It Actually Work?</h2>

<p>Yeah, embarrassingly well. The friction of having to justify myself to an AI is surprisingly effective. When I’m about to type “I just want to browse Reddit” I realize how pathetic that sounds and often just go to bed. Which was the whole point.</p>

<h2 id="update-daytime-features">Update: Daytime Features</h2>

<p>After using this for a few days, I wanted the same focus superpowers during the day too. So I added daytime features:</p>

<p><strong>Focus Mode</strong>: One-click blocking of distracting sites (YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, etc.). Uses both DNS and IP firewall blocking – so you can’t bypass it by using the IP address directly. Customize which sites get blocked via a settings page.</p>

<p><strong>Voluntary Lockdown</strong>: Full internet block during daytime – same AI chat to get back online. For deep work sessions where you want zero distractions.</p>

<p><strong>Stats Dashboard</strong>: Charts showing usage patterns over time. Scatter plot shows request times and durations. Bar chart breaks down by weekday. Night/Day tabs let you see nighttime requests separately from daytime Focus Mode and Lockdown usage.</p>

<p>The UI also theme-switches – golden during the day, dark at night. Nice visual cue for which mode you’re in.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Built an AI that guards my internet at night because I have zero self-control. It works better than willpower. Claude Code built most of it in one evening but still needed a human to catch the integration bugs. Source code on GitHub if you want to build your own digital parent.</p>

<h1>Heater Spiral</h1>
<h2>Heat-based body-computer interface pendant</h2>
<section>
<img src="/images/portfolio/projects/rendered_heater_spiral.png" alt="Front of Heater Spiral PCB" />
</section>
<section>
<h3>Overview</h3>
Heater Spiral is a wearable body-computer interface that delivers gentle, programmable warmth through a spiral heater trace. I designed and assembled the circular PCB from scratch, integrating a MOSFET-controlled heater that can raise the surface temperature to around 50&nbsp;°C. One application I explored was wearing it as a necklace over the heart with rhythmic warm-up and cooldown phases to anchor attention in the body—similar to metta meditation sessions I tested during retreat. I also prototyped an app that modulates heat based on how near another wearer is, and I plan to redesign the next iteration with a UWB chip for more accurate distance sensing.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
This project started when I stumbled upon a <a href="https://x.com/arram/status/1438541186319282178">video by Arram Sabeti on Twitter</a> showing mesmerizing animated Doyle spirals etched into metal. I was so captivated by the effect that I had to rebuild it myself.

Doyle Studio is a generative art tool I created to compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doyle_spiral" target="_blank">Doyle spirals</a> and more patterns that can be exported as SVGs for fabrication with a fiber laser. The software can be used to animate geometric textures on a rotating disk, then translate the animations into physical pieces through engraving angled line patterns with a fibo laser. The current pipeline renders animated patterns and generates high-resolution SVGs for
laser engraving. The surfaces reflection sequences can be changed based on the angle of the engrave line pattern similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoetrope" target="_blank">zoetrope</a>.

<h3>Experiments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tested both steel etching and wood lasering; both work, but steel is more promising for crisp contrast and durability.</li>
<li>Ongoing tuning of fabrication settings to make the animated motion very clearly visible in the etched results.</li>
<li>Planned animation UI driven by cellular automata rules to vary the Doyle spiral parameters over time.</li>
<li>Future experiments with pixel-grid renderings to compare against the smooth circle packings for alternative animation aesthetics.</li>
</ul>

And to be completely honest, a part of me felt a long retreat was what I needed to become enlightened. The retreat and teacher promised to meet each moment of experience fully, welcoming each moment fully. The two months of practice brought me face to face with all that I subconsciously also wanted to transcend and leave behind. I learned that I could be with more of my experience without freaking out and dying than I had thought. Most of the scary things were all just sensations. After one month I felt that I would already be happy with being able to feel all my emotions rather than needing to awaken.</p>

<p>All in all practice felt like easing into a medium acid trip with the dosage increasing very slowly each day. Also, I had major troubles with the teacher. I learned and noticed that I could practice in a way that brings me down into the body and that this is what I need to do to live my humanity. Before my practice had been transcending the body. What is still with me is a deeper trust in life and my experience. I laugh more easily and freely, multiple friends and acquaintances have commented on it. Also, in difficult times intuitively I turn to practice. My sense of time has shifted, the retreat felt like it was just a day. Now I usually find myself in the moment without feeling time pass. Also, my motivation to practice is way higher, I can feel that practice is slowly burning away old karma. I got a sense of tasting emptiness as all-encompassing love and that I might be able to infuse my whole experience with within this life time.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-emotions">what are emotions?</h2>

<p>I practiced a Rob Burbea retreat on emotions for a couple of days at the end of the retreat: <a href="https://dharmaseed.org/retreats/1466/">The boundless heart</a>. From that, I got a sense of looking at the emotional body, the axis from the perineum to the top of the head. When I checked in the sensations, I could feel how what I consider emotions is mapped onto that. For example, shame is tension in the lower belly; fear lives in tension in the belly and throat and shoulders, love and spaciousness live as warmth and softness in the heart. Also, most of the time it was impossible for me to name the emotion, the combination of tensions and sensations was so unique in each moment of experience. From Rob, I got the idea that it’s okay that in practice there doesn’t have to be a cathartic release. And it pointed me to our nature beyond conceptual ideas. Looking at the emotional body there were so many different states that shift constantly that it was clear that I am not a conceptual thing. I can’t grasp myself using words, concepts or the mind.</p>

<p>Additionally, listening to the retreat recordings taught me to feel the tensions in the body and imagine a soft white bubble of spaciousness around them. This really helped to feel the unpleasant tensions that were present. And I played with a suggestion of Rob to imagine the world as sacred. Indeed after a day of holding that idea lightly everything around me felt like something more meaningful and sacred. It was subtle but clear how much ideas and views shape perception. Also from that recording I played with just expressing limited beliefs verbally and repeating them, e.g. “I need to be a good boy”. After a while of doing that, I laughed and the belief just released. I loved Rob’s input which always included a sense that everything is just a view and there is no solid meditation approach, you don’t need to twist yourself into pretzelshape to meditate. That helped me to let go of this archetype of what meditation and awakening look like for me. Rob also mentioned that there is no way around the fact that the Buddha in the Pali canon proposes a kind of aloofness and transcendence of the humanness and world. I always struggled with a sense of that and it was encouraging to hear from Rob that he finds that practice can go together with engagement and longing that is part of our human form.</p>

<h3 id="emotional-release">emotional release</h3>

<p>At the retreat we did breathwork every morning. Screaming and kicking was a great way to release anger. At some point, I put up a boxing sack in a little hut. I could really notice that whenever I felt depressed and stuck and I went punching the bag I would feel more whole and loving afterwards. It really helped me to meet and love anger. I could sense when after tapping into anger fear would rise to block it. But I slowly went deeper and deeper. At some point, I was surprised how hard I could kick when I really allowed the anger. I realized that I normally have my handbrakes on my own strength, perceiving myself as much weaker because of my resistance to feeling anger. After the first month of practice, I was able to tap into anger and fear like never before in my life. I made it a habit to spend one to two hours every day to feel into anger and fear. Singing, laughing, punching, jumping. Sometimes it would have looked like me being crazy from the outside when I was actually just processing my emotions.</p>

<p>Normally, in society, controlling your emotions is the norm, feeling them and expressing them fully is considered crazy, except if you’re an actor. I would go on walks sometimes just singing and laughing by myself, after weeks of retreat practice, I lost my sense of fear of being judged. One night, when I was laughing, it triggered one of the neighbors who came on his ATV towards me and, with huge anger, told me to stay away from his property and that he would call the police on me otherwise. Also, he had a dead pig on the back of his vehicle. Probably, he was just scared and triggered by me expressing my emotions more fully. Here, I could really notice the effect of the practice. Normally I would have been triggered by this. But after all my anger release work I could stay calm and spacious and I tried to communicate that I was on a mediation retreat and that I would respect his property. As he drove off I couldn’t help but continue laughing.</p>

<h2 id="weeks-of-internal-family-systems">weeks of Internal Family Systems</h2>

<p>For the first three weeks, I heavily practiced <a href="https://ifs-institute.com">internal family systems</a>. It’s a therapy modality that has helped me tremendously. The main idea is that our minds are not a monolithic entity, but a plural system of parts. It helps in relating to parts and experiences differently, with acceptance and love. During this time I encountered so many parts that had strange worldviews and beliefs that I was never aware of before. Patiently I again and again reminded so many parts that I am an adult and that I do not live with my parents anymore. Also, I learned to communicate and befriend parts of myself. I asked parts questions and offered them to be friends and to work together. This was really noticeable after three weeks. I would look into the mirror and the voice in my head would say “You look great, I love you”. I would drop something and the voice would say “No worries, I love you”. That was so amazing that I could rewire my inner dialogue that way. Then there were experiences of talking to parts leading to my entire body tingling. My sense of the work was that IFS is similar to practicing metta (loving-kindness). The verbal component helps the mind to have a little bit of an illusion of control, which eased me into letting go. Talking from the IFS Self felt similar to generating metta, while the voice would talk, tensions in the body would unwind and soften.</p>

<h2 id="deconstructing-myself-and-jhana-practice">deconstructing myself and jhana practice</h2>

<p>My main practice was metta practice. Since accessing jhana four in my <a href="/meditation/jhanas/therapy/english/2024/01/01/what-i-learned-about-meditation-love-and-trauma-on-and-after-a-twim-retreat-with-delson-armstrong.html">last retreat</a> I wanted to continue and progress. So I kept radiating metta from my head in six directions. At some point I was doing that throughout the day. I did not progress into other Jhanas, unfortunately. Still staying in the fourth Jhana set forth some processes. I felt that with time passing on, my body felt thinner and lighter, more nebulous. That seemed to be correlated with my sense of self feeling very thin as well. At some point, my visual field started flickering all the time when I closed my eyes or after a longer sitting. I could glimpse that I was seeing frames of experience and how the flickering correlated with the muscles around my eyes tensing slightly. I could sense that the tension around the eyes would come every time a sense of self was created. And this all also correlated with any shift of tensions in the body, the body would take a slightly new shape and I could intuit that that constituted a new sense of self.</p>

<p>At some point, I had the insight that does sound obvious but felt very freeing to me that I am living in the present and that each self is created in the present, and that I felt free from my past. I had a sense that my sense of self was unraveling faster and faster. I remember that in one meditation I went through my whole life chronologically and at some point realized that in all the images I couldn’t find myself, I was not in my memories. Somehow that also felt deeply freeing.</p>

<h2 id="changes-in-awareness">changes in awareness</h2>

<p>I could feel my awareness becoming wider after a couple of weeks. For example, I could look at a cornfield with a wide awareness and I could see the waves of the wind on the entire cornfield at the same time rather than only seeing a part of it. The first time I noticed it, it felt psychedelic. Also later after the retreat how the ocean looked changed. Seeing wave patterns with wide awareness is so fascinatingly beautiful.</p>

<p>Another thing that stood out was that I could remember most of my dreams. And after a couple of weeks due to my metta practice a golden heart would start appearing again and again in my dreams.</p>

<h2 id="narcissism-in-meditation-teachers-and-the-guru-pattern">narcissism in meditation teachers and the guru pattern</h2>

<p>I was clear that I needed to properly vet the teacher since the retreat in silence for two months meant that my only external input would be the teacher since we would vow to not read, write, or communicate with anyone outside the retreat. The teacher was very welcoming and accommodating, it felt like he gave a lot of space and was sensitive to my special needs and concerns due to undertaking this long retreat knowing I have a lot of childhood trauma to work with.</p>

<p>But the longer the retreat progressed it felt to me, the more controlling and grandiose the teacher became. At times I felt it was more important to him to be seen as a great teacher and get validation from his students. So much so, that it interfered with building a trusting student teacher relationship. For the time I was there the teacher did not allow question during dharma talks. Also, there was some controlling behavior (e.g. lashing out at somebody being sad or somebody being late). For example even though the teacher verbally welcomed students crying emotionally it felt like crying made him uncomfortable which probably made it harder to process grief I had. Sometimes I felt what he was talking about was in contradiction with his actions. Considering he had 15 years of intensive practice in monasteries under his belt and had deep awakening experiences, it made clear to me that awakening and meditation practice would not solve all my problems as I had hoped. So from this, I realized that I want to give relational practice and trauma therapy a higher priority in my life.</p>

<p>With more time passing I found myself getting more and more angry at the teacher and my thoughts revolving mainly around the teacher. I have not had such an experience on my other retreats. After describing the situation to my therapist she suggested: “oh seems like narcissism”. That was such a huge relief to have a word for what was so confusing. I noticed that just sitting in front of the teacher would shift sensations in my stomach, maybe because of the concentration practice and spaciousness through his practice, emotions such as anger would be transmitted in a way that is very hard to notice. It felt like there was anger packaged in spaciousness, so that my mind wouldn’t catch it but my body reacted and it felt like watching a reality distortion field at work. My sense was that the Guru phenomenon might work like this. Somebody with very high concentration powers transmits his reality just through presence without even talking, sidestepping the mind. With enough concentration or awareness, you can overwrite somebodies else’s body sensations if they have less concentration powers and they won’t even notice for a while. You don’t need to be louder or openly aggressive, just by having more concentration you can bend social reality around you. While the student is questioning his feelings of confusion the guru has already repeated his reality through concentration abilities a hundred times and will overwrite the student’s body sensations just through presence.</p>

<p>While these issues were major I also felt that the teacher was genuinely trying his best and he did also had a truly loving and accepting side that I have not come across in many people. He had a sensitivity and ability to say the right thing in tense situations, which really helped me to accept myself. So I was able to work with his sides that were troubling to me to work out certain woundings from my childhood. I was able to see my own narcissism and how that was the prerequisite to falling for others’ narcissism. I could only believe other grandiose parts when I took my own grandiosity too seriously. When I could laugh about my own parts thinking they were better than everybody else I could also laugh when I saw those parts in the teacher. Now, three month later I can tell that despite all these troubling aspects the teacher was safe enough for me to work out issues I had with my parents a bit.</p>

<h2 id="dissociative-identity-disorder-long-retreat-and-heavy-practice">Dissociative Identity Disorder, long retreat and heavy practice</h2>

<p>Just the month before starting the retreat I have started to internalize that I have Dissociative Identity Disorder. That means having different altars/personalities that take over. This leads to some confusions in everyday life because these selves sometimes don’t share memories very well or at all. This explained my changing perception of time. My life used to feel like a movie with many fast cuts, it was chaotic and disorienting. About two years ago after heavy practice and developing the witness my life started feeling like a continuous movie.</p>

<p>On retreat, I got to know different selves and their purposes. I mainly noticed it as different voices in my head at first. I would ask them for their names and ages. I had the astonishing experience of first time intuitively noticing co-consciousness, I was aware that another self was leading my body. But I could talk to that self and also I could intervene whenever I wanted. Then another mindboggling experience was when I realized a switch between altars in hindsight. I sat down to meditate and started interacting with a very friendly voice, then the realization hit me that yesterday I was that voice I was talking to now. But now I identified with a different voice. This all gave me a lot of self-trust. While the selves and identity were changing, awareness stayed awake throughout. To be honest before it was a little terrifying to realize that my current self could disappear and I don’t know when or if it (I) would come back. Kinda like sleeping only without a choice about when or how long. That experience showed me that awareness remains and safety lies in resting in awareness.</p>

<h2 id="sexual-trauma-coming-up-on-retreat">sexual trauma coming up on retreat</h2>

<p>One of the reasons I wanted to go on this retreat was to work with sexual trauma from my childhood. Unfortunately, because of the mentioned issues with the teacher, I did not feel comfortable sharing what was going on for me in that regard with him. Still, I had some healing experiences. One thing I noticed in the first week was that just sitting still for this long can be a trigger in itself, reminding the body of freeze and helplessness. So I introduced movement in my practice with a focus on power stances. E.g. putting fists on the legs, pushing out the arms outwards, moving the head around before each sit or during.</p>

<p>Then as with time after a couple weeks sexual feelings would come up during sits. It was related to awareness coming into my perineum. I realized that I haven’t breathed fully and deeply before because doing so will make attention travel to the perineum at the end of an in-breath. Now the talk of the root chakra as the source of life energy made sense to me. I was likely cut off from it due to it triggering body memories of sexual experiences and trauma. So I spent a few sits just sitting with the feelings, working through many memories of past sexual partners.</p>

<p>After a while, I also noticed that before going to sleep I would feel fear in my stomach and sensation in my perineum. I realized that my sleeping issues for my whole life must have come from my body replaying sexual trauma memories before going to bed. At this point of the retreat, I could bring up metta to accept these sensations. And yoga nidra was very helpful. With time the sensations became less scary, the fear of them was worse than the sensations themselves. But to me, it really brought home the message that the body keeps the score. Hundreds of nights spent on Youtube or other procrastinations to escape these sensations without me even being aware that this was driving my behaviour. With more time I could go to sleep more easily.</p>

<p>And I found a few parts in myself that had quite strange and extreme beliefs due to the sexual trauma. E.g. I found a part that thought it was my perpetrator and during a sit, I found traumatic imagery where the perspective was such as if I had abused myself. A lot of shame was tied to that. Generally, there were a lot of parts that hated me and it was quite a journey working with them. First I tried to befriend them, but even after weeks, they kept saying abusive things. So then I set boundaries with them “You can’t talk to me like that. We can talk if you are more friendly.”. That and teaching other parts or altars that were targets to hold boundaries helped. I kept repeating that it was not my or any parts fault throughout the entire retreat.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>

<p>The retreat was such a valuable experience for me. It gave me more trust in my awareness and that I will be okay. I could see how fear most of the time is worse than whatever I was afraid of. Also, it taught me gentleness, slowly accepting, and being with experience. From this, I also realized the importance of the body and that radiating metta from my head would lead to some kind of transcendence of my humanity. Even though it feels nice, being with my body, chakras and emotions is key for humaning with more ease. Fortunately, I was blessed to be able to spend a month at Esalen right after, where I learned the value of body work and relational awareness practices for healing and being.</p>]]></content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="[&quot;meditation&quot;, &quot;jhanas&quot;, &quot;therapy&quot;, &quot;English&quot;]" /><category term="meditation" /><category term="jhanas" /><category term="therapy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After my last retreat experiences left me with a taste of the joy, love, and freedom that practice can bring it felt like a natural step to find out what would happen if I practiced even more.

<h3>Overview</h3>
 
Anattā is an experiment in which you are invited to be playful with your identity and that of someone else. Anattā (“non-self”) is a term from Buddhist texts and practices. This experiment for two people invites you to expand the space around the fixed self and to experience that it may not be quite as solid and stable as we often assume. How does it feel to be me?
 
How does someone who is not me feel? How does it feel when both categories dissolve?
In 2025 I modified the mirror with two time-of-flight laser sensors so visitors can use hand gestures in front of the surface to control how the two reflections merge, bringing agency and playfulness directly into the blending effect.

Experiment suggestion:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Stand with another human on each side of the mirror</li>
  <li>Position yourselves so that your faces overlap exactly</li>
  <li>steel wire</li>
  <li>Turn the dial to adjust the frequency of the light</li>
</ul>
</p>
Two-way mirror
 
The glass is coated with, or has been encased within, a thin and almost transparent layer of metal (window film usually containing aluminium). The result is a mirrored surface that reflects some light and is penetrated by the rest. Light always passes equally in both directions. However, when one side is brightly lit and the other kept dark, the darker side becomes difficult to see from the brightly lit side because it is masked by the much brighter reflection of the lit side.

Through that, I already discovered that I and my friends often use shame and guilt to try to control each other. After becoming aware of that I dropped a lot of these patterns. When I started on my meditative path I started with a guided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5a028RS5Ck">TWIM metta meditation</a>. During that practice after a month I accidentally dropped into the first and second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K5ypXyF3dY">Jhana</a>, thinking I might be having a stroke. So after practicing different models, I returned to TWIM, knowing its power, since firstly loving kindness simply feels good and also many people report that it’s the faster path and that it helps avoid dark night of the soul type of episodes.</p>

<h2 id="forgiveness-practice-trauma-and-finding-a-safe-anchor-in-the-heart">forgiveness practice, trauma and finding a safe anchor in the heart</h2>

<p>This has been the second silent retreat of my life after the <a href="/meditation/jhanas/therapy/english/2023/04/20/my-first-five-day-silent-retreat-jhanas-and-alexander-technique.html">6-day silent retreat</a> with Catherine McGee at Gaia House earlier this year. On the first day everyone had to lock away their phone so for the next 10 days I’d be fully with my experience with little distractions. I started with forgiveness practice for the first three days of the retreat. That meant that I would observe all the thoughts I had throughout the day and forgive them. And I was in for a shock. The whole day my mind was thinking thoughts that were completely referring to the past. My thoughts were mainly going back to replaying situations from my childhood and school as a teenager. Silence at the dinner table due to being on a silent retreat? My mind wouldn’t care and started thinking about being in trouble because there must be some conflict at the dinner table. Looking deeper of course that was how my childhood dinner with family looked like very often. My mind did not care that I was now an adult sitting with meditators at a silent dinner table. I knew I had an at times very abusive upbringing with psychological and physical violence, but after this experience, it became very clear to me that my mind was still living in that time for the majority of the day. No wonder that I was having trouble with depressive episodes and anxiety for all my life. It was likely mostly the body-mind replaying past memories and patterns.
 During the first days of forgiveness meditation, I forgave every thought I had. I had some tears coming up at times, but was never able to really let go and cry. In hindsight, since I could totally do that after the retreat I think that some part of me was holding back and was not feeling fully safe to allow feeling the grief. At times I could also catch some suicidal thoughts, a car going by and some thought of jumping in front of it would come up. I forgave myself for that and also used some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model">IFS moves</a> to ask that part of myself for its reasons. It turned out that the part wanted to protect me from experiencing pain, which I thanked it for and explained that I have learned ways to deal with pain and stay alive. Additionally, I developed a rash around my eyes for a couple of days that probably were the result of some triggers making the body release lots of cortisol.</p>

<p>A couple of days later Delson had me switch to loving kindness practice. His presence was such that it felt like he was practicing what he was preaching. He felt very present in the moment and it felt like whatever emotion, worry, etc. I threw at him would dissipate into equanimity. Besides the technical instructions the interviews conveyed a deep sense of trust in the process and it felt like the core message was: Everything will unfold by itself, accept whatever is arising.</p>

<p class="caption"> An excerpt from my notebook.</p>
<p> At the middle of the retreat, I started to have such fine awareness and control over my attention that I could play with it and spread it in a circle around my head, move it to any body part, and spread it across the entire body. Having this great detailed awareness of where my attention is spatially was so fun and nothing I ever experienced so strongly outside retreat. Then after some time, I would start to have trouble falling asleep. A lot of fear would come up before sleeping. The most magnificent thing I noticed there was how my consciousness would be pulled by some force into the past, some traumatic memories. I did not access them, it was just a hunch. And then I could immediately feel how attention would be pulled back to my heart. I would then invoke some metta (feeling of loving kindness) and lie in bed with warmth spreading out from the heart in my chest and I felt protected from this movement of mind trying to pull me into the past. After that experience, I was sure that I want to permanently have what Delson called a lighthouse or anchor in the heart. According to Delson that is the only kind of real safety we can have and it made a lot of sense to me. It made sense not logically, but experientally it became very clear to me that this is true and incredibly powerful and valuable.</p>

<h2 id="expanded-awareness-and-alexander-technique">expanded awareness and Alexander Technique</h2>
<p> At some point in the middle of the retreat, I figured out that I was doing everything I did with an amount of unnecessary tension. When I notice that and relax it’s the same move as taught in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Technique">Alexander Technique</a> class. Only that I rediscovered it by myself as a byproduct of meditation. If I relax in that way my spine extends, my shoulders broaden and my awareness widens. It was obvious that the form of the body and that of consciousness are directly linked, in everyday life I just often lack the fine-tuned perception to catch it. I could very clearly notice how I had the habit of making myself small by tensing up and that I could just relax instead. My awareness of my body increased by a factor of ten. I felt like my upper body was noticeably bigger than how I felt it in everyday life before. I learned a motion indescribable by words where I could relax in a way that my neck would get long and it felt like it grew 10cm even though I know that was physically not the case but the feeling was such. It was like I learned to un-tense into confidence. The first couple times it felt like my shoulders are in the wrong place, above where they were supposed to be. But that was just my habit of making myself small. In my teacher interview, I asked if permanent expanded awareness was something I would get from continuing the practice. Delson told me that this was not the ultimate goal but a side effect. I could see how in my experience I would get triggered and my awareness would be contracted. And how ultimately healing and meditation are intertwined in that staying in expanded awareness is a result of healing or having integrated most triggers.</p>

<h2 id="deepening-practice-and-insight">deepening practice and insight</h2>

<p>During my sits, I would just think of a spiritual friend at the start to invoke metta. I did that for a while and the metta got stronger and stronger. At some point, it got so strong that I would always get a bright flickering white light after sitting for a while. At some point, I was given the instructions to radiate the metta into six directions from my head. I proceeded to do so. This felt different. The metta felt more tranquil and from my understanding was Jhana four. I radiated it to all six directions and at the same time followed the instruction to just let the meditation happen instead of trying to meditate. It was kinda like radiating a white flickering fog out of my head, kinda like when you are on an airplane and you fly through a cloud and look out the window. I could notice how I was focusing on the feeling of metta radiating and then some tension in my body arose and I would just relax it. On one day when I felt like it was the deepest I ever got in meditation, I could see how there were tension knots in my body and then they would bubble upwards into my head where a little bubble would pop, and then in its place a thought would appear. I could see how thoughts were directly caused by the tensions in my body. That felt very trippy and since I was completely sober it’s harder to dismiss than a psychedelic experience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/TWIM/thoughts.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption"> An excerpt from my notebook.</p>

<p>Also at some point in meditation, I was just watching how the meditation was happening, I was watching how something that was not me was relaxing tensions in my field of awareness. Then relaxing that one tension would reconfigure the whole tension pattern and like solving a puzzle something would relax another tension knot. All of that was just happening by itself. It felt like I was watching the mind or consciousness like my core learning algorithm executing. Was that happening all the time on the low level and I just never looked so deep into what was going on? Since I was not able to see this deep after retreat again this experience has been hard to integrate.</p>

<p>Some other finer points of consciousness and meditation I learned. First I asked Delson if I should stop looking for blockages, hidden grief etc. and his answer was that I should let everything just come up by itself. Also that I should watch for what the intention behind looking for blockages is, if it is aversion I should beware. Then there are constructive jhanas as in invoking them by using metta or concentration and deconstructive jhanas as in if I simply relaxed I would end up in a jhanic state at some point without trying to get there. I asked Delson about how therapy is replacing one tension pattern with another whereas the TWIM meditation is just relaxing it fully and he confirmed that this is the case. Also, he said that it is not necessary to be fully aware of what I am letting go of. There will always be some tensions, just accept them. Also what I found interesting was how during the interviews Delson would sometimes look away and look back at me when I would un-tense. It seemed like he was somehow rewarding me nonverbally for un-tensing which I found interesting.</p>

<h2 id="metta-circle-and-feeling-the-intimacy-of-the-moment">metta circle and feeling the intimacy of the moment</h2>

<p>Another great experience at the retreat was the metta circle on one of the last days led by Delson’s assistants. The idea was that we would sit in a group of about 15 in a circle and one of us would sit in the middle and then everyone would close their eyes and send loving kindness to the person in the middle. That was huge for me. I was a bit skeptical if I could feel it or let the love in. But when it was my turn and I sat in the middle I noticed I was trying to receive the metta and just relaxed. At some point, my visual field just lit up with bright light and I wasn’t doing anything. I did not put in any effort and it felt like and the metta was stronger than in many of my sits. This was a huge eye-opener for me and I realised that I could just do the same thing in my sits, fully receiving the metta instead of efforting to create it. Also, this gentle, respectful way of showering someone with love opened my eyes to how in my everyday life I always thought I had to do something to show love and affection when actually it was also possible in this incredibly gentle way. I also remember that sometimes I would feel lonely and miss my friends, but just sitting with tea in the dining hall in the presence of another retreatant would dissolve it, it was great to be able to appreciate this subtle feeling of togetherness and connection without any words. These encounters revealed the intimacy of everyday moments that normally would have gone past me.</p>

<h2 id="feeling-the-calling-of-the-dharma">feeling the calling of the dharma</h2>

<p>Also on the last day the noble-silence was ended for everyone. I could feel how that brought up some social anxiety and how interacting with others would bring up more triggers and I could feel how it required booting up some sense of self for me. Everyone was incredibly diverse and I talked to a bunch of folks and what struck me was how it seemed that the longer folks practiced the more themselves and normal they seemed to me. Somehow it correlated with how much they dared to be themselves. I somehow had this image in my mind that the advanced practitioners would fit some peaceful and serene image of Buddhist monks. It was hugely inspiring that they seemed like normal folks. Also, I could tell that those who had a lot of practice were somehow easy to talk to and it was like spending time with them was transmitting some openness and easefullness effortlessly. To me, it seemed like I was being drawn in by that and it was the dharma speaking to me and inviting me to go further. What stuck in my mind was that someone told me “If you give to the dharma, the dharma will give to you”. The whole experience was amazing, there were these humans that I just met 10 days ago and they were all so loving and kind to me. It felt like they were all my friends. It resembled some memories from my techno clubbing days in Berlin where with the help of MDMA in the after hour everyone was also exceptionally open and friendly with each other. But here on the retreat, it felt more heartfelt and genuine than the chemical kindness of MDMA. But there were similarities, just pointing out how great and beautiful the world looked to each other all the time and being all smiles. Also I could glimpse how powerfully different it is to see the world where everyone is my friend by default and I could see that it is possible to see the world that way through practice.</p>

<p>Still, I sensed that underneath all the metta was still some fundamental fear present in me. Going out in the world was like seeing everything for the first time. I looked at everyone’s faces and when I sat for meditation I could just go to the first or fourth Jhana in a couple minutes which was amazing. And it felt like I could do this even while walking or sitting somewhere not formally meditating. Sitting at the airport all the kindness from the folks at the retreat hit me and I cried for an entire hour during a sit. I felt that the world and people were good and kind and that I had this image of humans as inherently dangerous learned from my abusive upbringing that was just not true. I realised that love and kindness could feel this good and safe and that I probably hadn’t experienced that in a group so immediately in this way before. I felt enormous gratitude.</p>

<h2 id="post-retreat-integration">post-retreat integration</h2>

<p>After the retreat, I became aware of how my mind lives in the past further, which seems almost funny, like thoughts looping after getting up about not wanting to get up, because I do not want to go to school. But the school my mind thinks it’s going to is the school I went to as a teenager. I had to explain to this part of me that I would never have to go to this school again. Then a couple of days later after the retreat ended I had a sit in front of a mirror and I experimented with sending myself love while looking into my own eyes. I noticed that when I do the Alexander Technique move of relaxing my body such that I become taller and wider and additionally keep attention in my eyes I started crying. My eyes felt painful, like a burning sensation which from my understanding might be resistance to feeling grief. I kept feeling it and cried for an hour during that sit. After that, the doors to grief were wide open. I cried every day, more after my sits during walks that lasted an hour up to three hours for the next weeks. It got pretty intense, I could catch glimpses of thoughts around this. That grief must be decade-old grief that I was never allowed to feel as a child. After a couple of weeks of that, I could also sense some feeling of hopelessness and even suicidal thoughts at times. I just noticed them and tried to send those parts of me love and compassion. The thing that ultimately stopped those thoughts from coming up again was a ketamine therapy I started later. While ultimately beneficial for my life I have to mention that it did destabilize my life for a couple of weeks. Paradoxically feeling safer in my own heart allowed me to make more risky decisions in changing my life and that kinda of led to more instability and change. So from the outside, it looked like I was in a worse place while it was reflecting the truth of where I always have been more honestly. Still, I learned that the retreat probably reduced some amount of dissociation considerably and that led to feeling that my life was out of alignment with my true needs and wants. That can be quite disturbing, but I kept trusting my heart and followed its advice. During sits, I could now discern between when my mind would answer and when my heart would answer, when in doubt I would listen to my heart.
 Also, there were some other consequences. With my master’s thesis, I started to write my one-page expose and I just felt how uninterested I was in the whole topic I chose. I realised that with my job and thesis topic, I chose things by that others considered them to be great. But these things actually for me were out of alignment with my true interests. And while there were fun sides to going to work, I dreaded doing the work, and then just went into a Jhana state at times, which made the work more pleasant. But over the long run, I couldn’t pretend to like something I did not like. Also, I was dealing with feeling through hours of grief each day and just did not have any energy left for doing much else except meeting friends and getting support to stay afloat. In hindsight, I should have planned two or three months of downtime after the retreat for integration.</p>

<p>The same with friends and my roommates doing things I did not feel good about. I somehow had weeks of difficult conversations with friends where I told them things were pre-retreat I would have been too afraid to speak about these things, too much aggression, passive-aggression, feeling jealous, and what I saw as unkind treatment of others. Also, I felt less defended and got a lot of feedback on where I was self-righteous, saw myself as a victim, and have been passive-aggressive. All in all a humbling experience to realise how blind I was to those things. I think because I found a home in my heart and was okay with feeling grief I stopped being afraid of doing things where I might lose some friendships as well as my self-image. So I was able to take bigger risks that I was not able to take before. I am more myself now. And I learned that doing the scary things was better for me and my friends in the long run. I was surprised by the understanding and encouragement I got from the majority of friends and strangers to be honest about what I think.</p>

<p>Overall this retreat experience and TWIM have profoundly shifted the trajectory of my life. I am very certain now that meditation is an extremely subtle but powerful practice to reduce my own and others’ suffering. During the retreat, many painful truths came up, and meeting them with patience and kindness was a great way to suffer less. A retreat can reduce dissociation to a degree that you might find yourself in a lot more perceived tension than pre-retreat.</p>

<p>May you find your path in your own time towards a home in your heart friend.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-by-chatgpt">TL;DR (by ChatGPT)</h2>

<p>This post details my transformative journey through a Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation (TWIM) retreat. It helped me break patterns of guilt and shame, uncover deep-seated traumas, and understand my depressive episodes and anxiety. The retreat fostered a sense of presence, acceptance, and expanded awareness in me. I gained insights into the mind-body connection and the power of love and kindness. Post-retreat, I experienced intense emotional release and self-realization, leading to significant life changes. I learned the importance of authenticity, honesty, and listening to my heart. The experience underscored the need for downtime after such an intense retreat for proper integration and adjustment. This retreat has been a life-changing journey, inspiring self-discovery and healing.</p>]]></content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="[&quot;meditation&quot;, &quot;jhanas&quot;, &quot;therapy&quot;, &quot;English&quot;]" /><category term="meditation" /><category term="jhanas" /><category term="therapy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been practicing tranquil wisdom insight meditation (TWIM), a powerful loving-kindness-based meditation system, for the past six months with a special focus on forgiveness practice.

According to Delson that is the only kind of real safety we can have and it made a lot of sense to me. It made sense not logically, but experientally it became very clear to me that this is true and incredibly powerful and valuable.</p>

<h2 id="expanded-awareness-and-alexander-technique">expanded awareness and Alexander Technique</h2>
<p> At some point in the middle of the retreat, I figured out that I was doing everything I did with an amount of unnecessary tension. When I notice that and relax it’s the same move as taught in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Technique">Alexander Technique</a> class. Only that I rediscovered it by myself as a byproduct of meditation. If I relax in that way my spine extends, my shoulders broaden and my awareness widens. It was obvious that the form of the body and that of consciousness are directly linked, in everyday life I just often lack the fine-tuned perception to catch it. I could very clearly notice how I had the habit of making myself small by tensing up and that I could just relax instead. My awareness of my body increased by a factor of ten. I felt like my upper body was noticeably bigger than how I felt it in everyday life before. I learned a motion indescribable by words where I could relax in a way that my neck would get long and it felt like it grew 10cm even though I know that was physically not the case but the feeling was such. It was like I learned to un-tense into confidence. The first couple times it felt like my shoulders are in the wrong place, above where they were supposed to be. But that was just my habit of making myself small. In my teacher interview, I asked if permanent expanded awareness was something I would get from continuing the practice. Delson told me that this was not the ultimate goal but a side effect. I could see how in my experience I would get triggered and my awareness would be contracted. And how ultimately healing and meditation are intertwined in that staying in expanded awareness is a result of healing or having integrated most triggers.</p>

<h2 id="deepening-practice-and-insight">deepening practice and insight</h2>

<p>During my sits, I would just think of a spiritual friend at the start to invoke metta. I did that for a while and the metta got stronger and stronger. At some point, it got so strong that I would always get a bright flickering white light after sitting for a while. At some point, I was given the instructions to radiate the metta into six directions from my head. I proceeded to do so. This felt different. The metta felt more tranquil and from my understanding was Jhana four. I radiated it to all six directions and at the same time followed the instruction to just let the meditation happen instead of trying to meditate. It was kinda like radiating a white flickering fog out of my head, kinda like when you are on an airplane and you fly through a cloud and look out the window. I could notice how I was focusing on the feeling of metta radiating and then some tension in my body arose and I would just relax it. On one day when I felt like it was the deepest I ever got in meditation, I could see how there were tension knots in my body and then they would bubble upwards into my head where a little bubble would pop, and then in its place a thought would appear. I could see how thoughts were directly caused by the tensions in my body. That felt very trippy and since I was completely sober it’s harder to dismiss than a psychedelic experience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/TWIM/thoughts.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption"> An excerpt from my notebook.</p>

<p>Also at some point in meditation, I was just watching how the meditation was happening, I was watching how something that was not me was relaxing tensions in my field of awareness. Then relaxing that one tension would reconfigure the whole tension pattern and like solving a puzzle something would relax another tension knot. All of that was just happening by itself. It felt like I was watching the mind or consciousness like my core learning algorithm executing. Was that happening all the time on the low level and I just never looked so deep into what was going on? Since I was not able to see this deep after retreat again this experience has been hard to integrate.</p>

<p>Some other finer points of consciousness and meditation I learned. First I asked Delson if I should stop looking for blockages, hidden grief etc. and his answer was that I should let everything just come up by itself. Also that I should watch for what the intention behind looking for blockages is, if it is aversion I should beware. Then there are constructive jhanas as in invoking them by using metta or concentration and deconstructive jhanas as in if I simply relaxed I would end up in a jhanic state at some point without trying to get there. I asked Delson about how therapy is replacing one tension pattern with another whereas the TWIM meditation is just relaxing it fully and he confirmed that this is the case. Also, he said that it is not necessary to be fully aware of what I am letting go of. There will always be some tensions, just accept them. Also what I found interesting was how during the interviews Delson would sometimes look away and look back at me when I would un-tense. It seemed like he was somehow rewarding me nonverbally for un-tensing which I found interesting.</p>

<h2 id="metta-circle-and-feeling-the-intimacy-of-the-moment">metta circle and feeling the intimacy of the moment</h2>

<p>Another great experience at the retreat was the metta circle on one of the last days led by Delson’s assistants. The idea was that we would sit in a group of about 15 in a circle and one of us would sit in the middle and then everyone would close their eyes and send loving kindness to the person in the middle. That was huge for me. I was a bit skeptical if I could feel it or let the love in. But when it was my turn and I sat in the middle I noticed I was trying to receive the metta and just relaxed. At some point, my visual field just lit up with bright light and I wasn’t doing anything. I did not put in any effort and it felt like and the metta was stronger than in many of my sits. This was a huge eye-opener for me and I realised that I could just do the same thing in my sits, fully receiving the metta instead of efforting to create it. Also, this gentle, respectful way of showering someone with love opened my eyes to how in my everyday life I always thought I had to do something to show love and affection when actually it was also possible in this incredibly gentle way. I also remember that sometimes I would feel lonely and miss my friends, but just sitting with tea in the dining hall in the presence of another retreatant would dissolve it, it was great to be able to appreciate this subtle feeling of togetherness and connection without any words. These encounters revealed the intimacy of everyday moments that normally would have gone past me.</p>

<h2 id="feeling-the-calling-of-the-dharma">feeling the calling of the dharma</h2>

<p>Also on the last day the noble-silence was ended for everyone. I could feel how that brought up some social anxiety and how interacting with others would bring up more triggers and I could feel how it required booting up some sense of self for me. Everyone was incredibly diverse and I talked to a bunch of folks and what struck me was how it seemed that the longer folks practiced the more themselves and normal they seemed to me. Somehow it correlated with how much they dared to be themselves. I somehow had this image in my mind that the advanced practitioners would fit some peaceful and serene image of Buddhist monks. It was hugely inspiring that they seemed like normal folks. Also, I could tell that those who had a lot of practice were somehow easy to talk to and it was like spending time with them was transmitting some openness and easefullness effortlessly. To me, it seemed like I was being drawn in by that and it was the dharma speaking to me and inviting me to go further. What stuck in my mind was that someone told me “If you give to the dharma, the dharma will give to you”. The whole experience was amazing, there were these humans that I just met 10 days ago and they were all so loving and kind to me. It felt like they were all my friends. It resembled some memories from my techno clubbing days in Berlin where with the help of MDMA in the after hour everyone was also exceptionally open and friendly with each other. But here on the retreat, it felt more heartfelt and genuine than the chemical kindness of MDMA. But there were similarities, just pointing out how great and beautiful the world looked to each other all the time and being all smiles. Also I could glimpse how powerfully different it is to see the world where everyone is my friend by default and I could see that it is possible to see the world that way through practice.</p>

<p>Still, I sensed that underneath all the metta was still some fundamental fear present in me. Going out in the world was like seeing everything for the first time. I looked at everyone’s faces and when I sat for meditation I could just go to the first or fourth Jhana in a couple minutes which was amazing. And it felt like I could do this even while walking or sitting somewhere not formally meditating. Sitting at the airport all the kindness from the folks at the retreat hit me and I cried for an entire hour during a sit. I felt that the world and people were good and kind and that I had this image of humans as inherently dangerous learned from my abusive upbringing that was just not true. I realised that love and kindness could feel this good and safe and that I probably hadn’t experienced that in a group so immediately in this way before. I felt enormous gratitude.</p>

<h2 id="post-retreat-integration">post-retreat integration</h2>

<p>After the retreat, I became aware of how my mind lives in the past further, which seems almost funny, like thoughts looping after getting up about not wanting to get up, because I do not want to go to school. But the school my mind thinks it’s going to is the school I went to as a teenager. I had to explain to this part of me that I would never have to go to this school again. Then a couple of days later after the retreat ended I had a sit in front of a mirror and I experimented with sending myself love while looking into my own eyes. I noticed that when I do the Alexander Technique move of relaxing my body such that I become taller and wider and additionally keep attention in my eyes I started crying. My eyes felt painful, like a burning sensation which from my understanding might be resistance to feeling grief. I kept feeling it and cried for an hour during that sit. After that, the doors to grief were wide open. I cried every day, more after my sits during walks that lasted an hour up to three hours for the next weeks. It got pretty intense, I could catch glimpses of thoughts around this. That grief must be decade-old grief that I was never allowed to feel as a child. After a couple of weeks of that, I could also sense some feeling of hopelessness and even suicidal thoughts at times. I just noticed them and tried to send those parts of me love and compassion. The thing that ultimately stopped those thoughts from coming up again was a ketamine therapy I started later. While ultimately beneficial for my life I have to mention that it did destabilize my life for a couple of weeks. Paradoxically feeling safer in my own heart allowed me to make more risky decisions in changing my life and that kinda of led to more instability and change. So from the outside, it looked like I was in a worse place while it was reflecting the truth of where I always have been more honestly. Still, I learned that the retreat probably reduced some amount of dissociation considerably and that led to feeling that my life was out of alignment with my true needs and wants. That can be quite disturbing, but I kept trusting my heart and followed its advice. During sits, I could now discern between when my mind would answer and when my heart would answer, when in doubt I would listen to my heart.
 Also, there were some other consequences. With my master’s thesis, I started to write my one-page expose and I just felt how uninterested I was in the whole topic I chose. I realised that with my job and thesis topic, I chose things by that others considered them to be great. But these things actually for me were out of alignment with my true interests. And while there were fun sides to going to work, I dreaded doing the work, and then just went into a Jhana state at times, which made the work more pleasant. But over the long run, I couldn’t pretend to like something I did not like. Also, I was dealing with feeling through hours of grief each day and just did not have any energy left for doing much else except meeting friends and getting support to stay afloat. In hindsight, I should have planned two or three months of downtime after the retreat for integration.</p>

<p>The same with friends and my roommates doing things I did not feel good about. I somehow had weeks of difficult conversations with friends where I told them things were pre-retreat I would have been too afraid to speak about these things, too much aggression, passive-aggression, feeling jealous, and what I saw as unkind treatment of others. Also, I felt less defended and got a lot of feedback on where I was self-righteous, saw myself as a victim, and have been passive-aggressive. All in all a humbling experience to realise how blind I was to those things. I think because I found a home in my heart and was okay with feeling grief I stopped being afraid of doing things where I might lose some friendships as well as my self-image. So I was able to take bigger risks that I was not able to take before. I am more myself now. And I learned that doing the scary things was better for me and my friends in the long run. I was surprised by the understanding and encouragement I got from the majority of friends and strangers to be honest about what I think.</p>

<p>Overall this retreat experience and TWIM have profoundly shifted the trajectory of my life. I am very certain now that meditation is an extremely subtle but powerful practice to reduce my own and others’ suffering. During the retreat, many painful truths came up, and meeting them with patience and kindness was a great way to suffer less. A retreat can reduce dissociation to a degree that you might find yourself in a lot more perceived tension than pre-retreat.</p>

<p>May you find your path in your own time towards a home in your heart friend.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-by-chatgpt">TL;DR (by ChatGPT)</h2>

<p>This post details my transformative journey through a Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation (TWIM) retreat. It helped me break patterns of guilt and shame, uncover deep-seated traumas, and understand my depressive episodes and anxiety. The retreat fostered a sense of presence, acceptance, and expanded awareness in me. I gained insights into the mind-body connection and the power of love and kindness. Post-retreat, I experienced intense emotional release and self-realization, leading to significant life changes. I learned the importance of authenticity, honesty, and listening to my heart. The experience underscored the need for downtime after such an intense retreat for proper integration and adjustment. This retreat has been a life-changing journey, inspiring self-discovery and healing.</p>]]></content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="[&quot;meditation&quot;, &quot;jhanas&quot;, &quot;therapy&quot;, &quot;English&quot;]" /><category term="meditation" /><category term="jhanas" /><category term="therapy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been practicing tranquil wisdom insight meditation (TWIM), a powerful loving-kindness-based meditation system, for the past six months with a special focus on forgiveness practice.

<h3>Overview</h3>
The Curium project was designed around the development of 12U CubeSats, using components primarily sourced from commercial manufacturers. We utilized a launch opportunity from the <a href="https://www.dlr.de/en/latest/news/2022/02/20220620_go-ahead-for-second-round-of-microlauncher-payload-competition" rel="nofollow">DLR microlauncher competition 2022</a>. I was part of the on board computer (OBC) team. The written code is publicly accessible on <a href="https://github.com/Curium-Five">github</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/curiumsat">gitlab</a>. The satellite was <a href="https://www.nanosats.eu/sat/curium-one">launched succesfully in July 2024</a> on Ariane 6.
