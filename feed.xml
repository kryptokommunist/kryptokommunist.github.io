FreeCAD is an amazing open source CAD program. It still amazes me that people created this for free and open source. The software is still in it’s alpha version and is far from perfect as you can tell by the current release version number 0.19 and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?t=43461&quot;&gt;heated discussions&lt;/a&gt; around how soon a 1.0 release could be reached. Still it’s usable and once you get the gist of it you can create powerful and complex designs. FreeCADs approach to CAD is a parametric design. That means that you specify shapes with parameters. This way you can change your design at any time just by tuning these parameters. For example with my lamp design the number of aluminium bars is a parameter I can simply tweak at any point in time. This gives great flexibility and allows for fast customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was seeing the potential of designing a parametric lamp and creating a web page where you could change the parameters to your liking and see a live 3D rendering of the changed lamp. But after some research I saw that this does not exist for FreeCAD yet. Some coincidences later I thought I could apply for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; project to get closer to realizing this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I sent out two applications: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VgfsD06Qvb87S-tQazfTsyYTp14Z3EjF4V9puPVNCTQ/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;A better IPython and Jupyter Notebook Integration for FreeCAD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lxe3MTVMQYnv6r3W7KuuzcKgY_rLS2Qgd6FjZlstwaU/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Measurement tool for FreeCAD&lt;/a&gt;. In the end the first one was chosen which was closer to my original idea that got me excited and on the path of applying. I definitely didn’t expect the application to succeed, but that might just be the classic imposter syndrome. I put in quite some thought researching the topic and contacted some of the previous students, I even the one who applied for the exact same idea some years before. He was so nice to send me a link to his old application so I could use the feedback he got on his application from back then. This was especially helpful since I didn’t get any feedback on my application that I admittedly started a bit late. After the acceptance the project started moving. The FreeCAD community ist mostly organized in an old school internet forum. I haven’t used one since I was active on an RC car forum when I was 14. Anyways here is the project thread: &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=46039&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gsoc-2020-interactivity-demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;It's not much, but it's honest work. This demo shows the benefits of using the Jupyter Notebook environment. You can quickly code an interactive UI that creates objects in a FreeCAD document and removes them again. Also you can see that the viewer will tell you the index of faces and edges. This is important if you want to script FreeCAD entirely in a notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a demo of the entire example Jupyter Notebook. Be aware that due to the missing Python kernel (this is just a static site) most of the interactivity is lost. For full interactivity you should run &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kryptokommunist/Jupyter_FreeCAD/blob/7dc507e295525909668996adf47bb0df68950fdf/FreeCAD%20inside%20Jupyter%20Notebook%20-%20Examples.ipynb&quot;&gt;the notebook&lt;/a&gt; yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;https://kryptokommun.ist/google-summer-of-code-2020&quot; style=&quot;width: 800px; display:block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But enough with the story telling let’s get to the technical details shall we? As said before, the project is targeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://jupyter.org&quot;&gt;Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/a&gt;. They allow users to run and visualize their code together with markdown text inside the web browser. The notebooks support a multitude of programming environments. One of them is Python. Since FreeCAD is a C++ application with an Python binding, that means we can script FreeCAD inside the notebook. Some members of the FreeCAD community played with the idea before and managed to get FreeCAD running from within the notebook. Unfortunately you had to start the entire desktop app along side if you wanted to visualize what you were scripting. This is were the GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project comes to play. The goal was to display the FreeCAD 3D view inside the notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the goal is to have a very general solution that will be able to display any content that exists inside the desktop apps 3D view we need to work directly with it’s scene graph. So how does FreeCAD generate it’s 3D view. Internally FreeCAD relies on an CAD library that calculates all shapes mathematically in an potentially infinite resolution. The visualization on the other hand is realized with an probably not widely know framework called &lt;a href=&quot;https://coin3d.github.io&quot;&gt;Coin3D&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully someone started creating a Python binding for the Coin3D library as a masterthesis. It still lives on under the name &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coin3d/pivy&quot;&gt;pivy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this the plan was to somehow extract the objects from the Coin3D scene graph and to then translate them into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL&quot;&gt;WebGL&lt;/a&gt; based library that can be rendered inside the notebook. Yikes this meant I might have to touch JavaScript which is not a beauty to work with. After some deliberations I chose &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs&quot;&gt;pythreejs&lt;/a&gt; which is a Jupyter Notebook extension that integrates the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js&quot;&gt;ThreeJS&lt;/a&gt; with a Python bridge. That meant less JavaScript and a smooth integration into the Jupyter Notebook environment. My previous experiments with directly inserting the ThreeJS JavaScript library all failed horribly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end the task was not that complex. All I needed to do was to extract faces and edges from the Coin3D scene graph and then reassemble it in a slightly modified structure inside pythreejs. What still made this project a challenge was starting from zero knowledge about FreeCADs internals and computer graphics. Additionally some potential bugs make their way into the project and finding and solving can take a lot of time. Also communication with many stake holder slows down the progress and it can be frustrating if you think you found a bug and then the project is not maintained regularly and you have to watch your &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs/issues/329&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs/issues/331&quot;&gt;die silently&lt;/a&gt; on Github. Overall it’s still a great experience to work so autonomously on an project that is used by so many people. So I hope there will be some people interested in using FreeCAD inside Jupyter Notebook as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will continue to improve the project in the future. You can find the repository here. If you use the module and encounter any issues or just find it useful, don’t hesitate to post to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=46039&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; or let me know with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kryptokommunist&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; or an issue in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kryptokommunist/Jupyter_FreeCAD&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But enough humble or not so humble brags. I wanted to condense what I have learned there into a text hopefully giving you guidance on whether to attend and what to expect at such an event aside from late Roman, decadent catering. The learnings are a combination of the practical bootcamp experiences as well as the accompanying lecture called &lt;a href=&quot;https://hpi.de/entrepreneurship/veranstaltungen/it-entrepreneurship-vorlesung.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT-Entrepreneurship&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Lots of people and obligatory branded T-shirts. (image: HPI / Kay Herschelmann)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;practical-experience-from-speakers&quot;&gt;Practical Experience from Speakers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most inspiring and motivating aspect is the wide array of guest speakers that speak about their own failures and success on the startup journey. The key take away from that for myself was that they were just normal people that just did stuff and never stopped trying. Some founded over a dozen companies that eventually failed before becoming part of the winning team. Also people founded companies early in their life but some even started at 40 and succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also many admitted that luck played a big part in the ultimate success. They hit a right trend, a growing market segment, some unlucky competitor went bankrupt or a huge company just somehow never bothered to develop a competing product. And clearly there were some that had a very noble mission and they were clearly striving to make the world better with their product and companies while others were more driven by success and more control over company culture than the actual product and it’s impact in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also talking to people from the Venture Capital world was interesting a guy that about every four sentences was saying “You need to ask where’s the money!” comes to mind. Also tales of how complicated regulatory rules for creating medical devices in Germany are were part of the learnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;team&quot;&gt;Team&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hpi_startup_bootcamp_team.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This is how a team could look like. (image: HPI / Kay Herschelmann)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founding team for a startup is essential for its survival. Since resources are scarce in the beginning the team will have to put up with a lot of pressure and needs to solve hard problems in a fast changing environment. The ideal size for a founding team is two to three people. Due to lack of resources and the necessity of fast execution the team members should know each other well so they can judge if they trust each other to manage to deliver in a startup setting. Furthermore the team should consist of smart and driven people, mediocre teams won’t build a great company. A complementary skill set also makes a good team, so there’s someone that is good at marketing and business, design and UX as well as someone comfortable with engineering and developing (Along the lines of Hipster, Hacker, Hustler).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal team for my startup would consist of one person with a business background who also has a very good understanding of the technology or sector the idea focuses on. This person should be able to understand and communicate complex ideas to a non-technical audience and have excellent people skills. Further the team should have a person that is highly technically competent. Additionally one person on the team should have competency in building front-end applications and graphics programming. All of these people would ideally already know each other for a while and be self-motivated and believing in the company’s mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;startup-idea&quot;&gt;Startup Idea&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two idea generation methods for startup ideas: &lt;em&gt;Problem Identification&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Technology Push&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Technology Push&lt;/em&gt; describes the process of pushing a new or existing technology out into the market for a use-case that currently is not addressed by the technology. Problem Identification on the other hand describes the reversed process of first identifying a problem by market research and observing users and then building a solution to the identified problem. Using your own problems is generally not recommended since you might be biased and the needs and requirements of yourself don’t have to reflect the needs and requirements of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my startup idea I used the &lt;em&gt;Technology Push&lt;/em&gt; approach. This was due to my own interest in the field of audio processing and having some technical experience within it. I did some cursory research and saw that there was no existing commercial audification player. Therefore my reasoning was, that this might be an idea that is not too obvious but at the same time possibly very useful to some use-cases. Even though the idea was inspired by Rolls-Royce’s bootcamp challenge, the hope is that this technology has a broader market beyond just addressing this particular problem. Therefore I’d categorize it as &lt;em&gt;Technology Push&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;leap-of-faith-hypotheses&quot;&gt;Leap of Faith Hypotheses&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every new startup there are new ideas and &lt;em&gt;leap of faith hypotheses&lt;/em&gt;. These are assumptions that you implicitly assume to be true without having actually tested them. For example with the &lt;em&gt;iPod&lt;/em&gt; there was the implicit assumption that most people would pay for digital music. Making these hypotheses explicit and methodically testing them will help you steer your startup into the right direction and avoid suffering from confirmation biases. It makes sense to differentiate between two kinds of leap of faith hypothesis: value and growth hypothesis. The value hypothesis concern the value provided to users by your product while growth hypothesis refer to growth assumptions. For my startup idea from the 2019 bootcamp these hypotheses were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/leap_of_faith_hypothesis.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The idea was audification of data streams in order to enable human data analysts to intuitively grasp what's going on in multidimensional data sets. Since you can process parallel sounds much more efficiently than multiple visual graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;interviews&quot;&gt;Interviews&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ground your product in reality and to reach customer and market fit it is beneficial to get external input through customer interviews. The main goal is to identify your specific customers needs, beware of the fact that what a customer says she wants and the actual need she has might not be related. The fundamentals of the customer interview are to stick and develop an interview script beforehand. Further you should ask for sufficient time. Lastly it is vital to immediately afterwards document the interview. The interviews should get you feedback for different phases of your startup. First in your beginning and ideation phase the &lt;em&gt;Problem Interview&lt;/em&gt; will help you to get a clearer picture of the problem and environment you chose. Next when you build a demo to address your problem a &lt;em&gt;Solution Interview&lt;/em&gt; will help you get feedback before starting to build the actual problem. And finally when you build your first product, your &lt;em&gt;MVP&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;MVP Interview&lt;/em&gt; you should test your messaging, pricing and activation flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;business-models&quot;&gt;Business Models&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three common business models are: &lt;em&gt;Direct Business Model&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Multisided Business Model&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Marketplaces&lt;/em&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;Direct Business Model&lt;/em&gt; advertises and sells directly to the user who pays for the product as its user. Different from that is a &lt;em&gt;Multisided Business Model&lt;/em&gt;, where the main users of a product pay indirectly, non monetarily while the monetization happens through another party paying for a derivative asset of the product, e.g. Facebook’s monetization of its users through selling ads. Slightly similar is the &lt;em&gt;Marketplace Business Model&lt;/em&gt; where buyers and sellers are matched through your product and the value exchange between them is direct unlike in advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lean-startup-approach&quot;&gt;Lean Startup Approach&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Build-Measure-Learn Cycle&lt;/em&gt; concept sees the startup as a machine that turns ideas into products and adapts quickly to learned lessons in order to create a successful product. This process can be seen as an iterative cycle with six stages: &lt;em&gt;Ideas, Build, Product, Measure, Data, Learn&lt;/em&gt;. With each Iteration of the process new learnings arise that will steer the decisions of the startup. This concept is similar to the Agile process or Design Thinking process with fast feedback and prototyping iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;offering-and-minimal-viable-product-mvp&quot;&gt;Offering and Minimal-Viable-Product (MVP)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to validate the &lt;em&gt;Problem-Solution-Fit&lt;/em&gt; you can use an offering. The offering is a test used to measure not what users say, but what they actually do. It consists of an &lt;em&gt;Unique Value Proposition, Demo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pricing&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Unique Value Proposition&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;UVP&lt;/em&gt;) is a promise about your solution to the customers. The Demo is an narrative that takes your &lt;em&gt;UVP&lt;/em&gt; and helps potential customers visualize and grasp it. The Pricing is an call to action that might even require an actual payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;MVP&lt;/em&gt; is a product comprised out of the minimum set of features in order to learn from early adopters. The goal is to enable fast iterations and early customer feedback to avoid building something that nobody wants. The difference to an offering is that an offering is not an actual product but a carefully scripted narrative about the product and not an functional product. The &lt;em&gt;MVP&lt;/em&gt; on the other hand is a functional product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;MVP&lt;/em&gt; for my startup would be an application that can load &lt;em&gt;CSV&lt;/em&gt; files from disk and output an audification whilst simultaneously showing the graphs so you can verify and understand that you are actually hearing the data characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;business-model-environment&quot;&gt;Business Model Environment&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key forces influencing the business model are: &lt;em&gt;Key Trends, Market Forces, Macro Economic Forces and Industry Forces&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Key Trends&lt;/em&gt; are general trends in various fields, they can be regulatory, societal, technological and more. &lt;em&gt;Market Forces&lt;/em&gt; are issues, needs and demands, segments of your market and similar items. &lt;em&gt;Macro Economic Forces&lt;/em&gt; relate to global economy, it’s infrastructure, commodity resources etc.. &lt;em&gt;Industry Forces&lt;/em&gt; consist of your competitors, your supply chain, substitute products and other examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;startup-marketing---aarrr-metrics&quot;&gt;Startup Marketing - AARRR Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AARRR Metrics&lt;/em&gt; are an acronym referring to &lt;em&gt;Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Revenue&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Acquisition Metrics&lt;/em&gt; are all related to where the users of the product are coming from what channels, what costs etc.. &lt;em&gt;Activation Metrics&lt;/em&gt; are about the first experience the user has with the product, at what point do you gain users to permanently use you product and show them the worth of it. &lt;em&gt;Retention Metrics&lt;/em&gt; measure what customers you are loosing and the reasons for that. &lt;em&gt;Referral Metrics&lt;/em&gt; measure why and how users become advocates for your product. &lt;em&gt;Revenue Metrics&lt;/em&gt; measure &lt;em&gt;Customer Lifetime Value&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Customer Acquisition Cost&lt;/em&gt; and other revenue related metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

In my case that usually has been about a month. And things go horribly wrong. On the one hand it means I learn something on the other hand it means things like burning 700 Euros for no other reason than being utterly stupid. Therefore I compiled this compact post about how to do things right from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;do-you-even-prepare-bro&quot;&gt;Do you even prepare bro?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preparing a trip is something I’d rather avoid doing, it’s just not any fun. I once was asked by a guy on the street if he could crash my couch. As it turned out he was travelling without anything. No money, no plan, not even a backpack. He was basically homeless, just with a drive to explore the world, which made all the difference. All he had was his T-shirt, pants, shoes and most importantly: His willingness to leave his comfort zone. &lt;!--more--&gt;He’d been doing it for years successfully. So of course I’d let him crash my couch. But since me and you aren’t that badass, unlike this inspiring fella, we need some preparation before taking off. Still he is living proof, how far you can get with literally nothing. So next time you get anxious about something, think of the guy that by default arrives with prospects of sleeping under the bridge but still manages to find a home to sleep (admittedly not always) and to enjoy his travels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;booking-flights&quot;&gt;Booking flights&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just don’t be a no-show for your outbound flight assuming you can just book a later one separately. Most airlines cheapest tickets don’t allow this and your return trip gets automatically cancelled. As a result I burned 700 Euros for buying new plane tickets. Therefore always check with the airline about cancellation/rebooking and no-show conditions because plane tickets are not sensible. Also make sure that you have check-in luggage included if you have multi destination flights. Consider buying that slightly more expensive ticket with a cancellation option if you aren’t one hundred percent sure about the travel date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;preparing-for-the-worst-case-before-your-trip&quot;&gt;Preparing for the worst case before your trip&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the bad things that can happen to you while travelling. Things where you’d go: “I’m so fucked! I’m so fucked! God, I am so fucked!”. You could get robbed, you could end up in a situation where every store is already closed and you’re starving. You could loose all your cash, you could loose your credit card. All these scenarios can reasonably happen and some I experienced myself. Therefore it is smart to prepare beforehand to at least mitigate some of the fallback of getting yourself in a messy situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring a food ration that’s enough for 3 days, I highly recommend very compact powder food, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jimmyjoy.com&quot;&gt;Jimmy Joy&lt;/a&gt;. Tastes good and can really save your ass.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring enough cash to survive for 3 days, even if it’s just in your own currency. You can change it at an money exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get information on how to report a lost credit card to your bank. If you know the phone number: If you can’t call them how can you do it with just internet?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find out what options you have if you lost your credit card. Does your bank provide you emergency cash and credit card? If not you should switch your bank. I can fully recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dkb.de/privatkunden/visa-card/&quot;&gt;DKB-Visa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a VoIP-number so you can make cheap phone calls to your bank or travel-insurance or other important institutions at your home country without going bankrupt. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.satellite.me&quot;&gt;Satellite&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll get 100 minutes for free!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you have a travel insurance and that they cover the country your visiting. If not it’s no more than 10 Euros a year so you don’t have to worry about getting sick or injured abroad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check if you should get special vaccinations for your destination. Sometimes your regular insurance will cover the costs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To prevent getting lost if you need to catch the last bus or to return your rented snow board gear, make sure to have offline maps and enough battery or as a backup a paper map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I lost my credit card before arriving in Tokyo. This was all the cash I had arriving at my hotel. All in all it was just enough to buy tickets from the airport to the hotel and the next Western Union branch next day after organizing emergency cash. I could not even afford a bottle of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;keeping-things-so-you-can-quickly-access-them&quot;&gt;Keeping things so you can quickly access them&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packing my bag inevitably led to chaos. Imagine the following scenario: Your on the train, you need to look up your next connection. Your phones battery is close to dying a painless but consequential death. You open your backpack and you hectically sort through the clutter. You’re getting stressed, your body emits stress hormones and as a result you die 5 years earlier than without this stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the solution, use see-through bags you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07DFD2NNJ/&quot;&gt;get on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. I sort everything in categories. E.g. important travel documents (passport, plane tickets), hygiene, plane utensils (sleeping mask, ear plugs) etc. This way you can quick access everything you need in seconds. It costs some preparation time to think of useful categories for the trip and sorting everything, but you will access any item in a matter of seconds without thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/travel_tips_access.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;With the bags I could easily access everything, here you can see my medication and my computer accessory bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/travel_tips_bags.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;There's even a bag for more bags. Just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;be-ready-for-exploring&quot;&gt;Be ready for exploring&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously you don’t want to carry around a giant backpack all the time, therefore just bring a smaller daypack with you. Make sure that it will neatly fit in your backpack, just like the sweet Russian Matryoshka dolls. If I board a plane I will keep the daypack separately with some items like laptop and e-reader. If I know I’ll have to transfer a lot, for example a bus ride and a connecting train afterwards, I’ll put everything inside the big backpack to ensure that I’ll only have to worry about one bag and I’ll have both hands free anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/travel_tips_daypack.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I proudly present: Bagpackception&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;backpack-protection&quot;&gt;Backpack protection&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For backpacks that you want to check-in just buy a backpack protection. A very simple one from Tatonka I can recommend is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.de/dp/B000FSEWJC&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. It’s very cheap, just eight Euros, and effective. This simple plastic bag is very sturdy and kept my backpack protected on five flights without any signs of deterioration. You should keep zip ties with you because the attached rope to tie the bag isn’t sufficient at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/travel_tips_bag1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;At the airport it takes no more than two minutes to put your backpack inside the cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/travel_tips_bag2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;And correctly ziptied at the top even this very cheap protection cover does it's job well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;boarding-like-a-pro&quot;&gt;Boarding like a pro&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I usually try to avoid long waiting times at the airport. That’s why I arrive at the gate later than most passengers. From this I realized that if you board the plane as last passenger you can just choose among all free seats. Now on long flights I’ll always be the last person boarding. If you’re lucky you’ll get the empty seat row you wouldn’t have gotten otherwise. So board the plane as the last person and choose where you sit freely. Sure you can’t just sit in business class, just because there’s a free seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Use your brains before making your life harder than necessary. Unlike at home whilst travelling there aren’t as many established structures you can rely on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="travel" /><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">I love travelling, every now and then I have the privilege to be able to travel abroad for a longer period. In my case that usually has been about a month. And things go horribly wrong. On the one hand it means I learn something on the other hand it means things like burning 700 Euros for no other reason than being utterly stupid. Therefore I compiled this compact post about how to do things right from the beginning. Do you even prepare bro? Preparing a trip is something I’d rather avoid doing, it’s just not any fun. I once was asked by a guy on the street if he could crash my couch. As it turned out he was travelling without anything. No money, no plan, not even a backpack. He was basically homeless, just with a drive to explore the world, which made all the difference. All he had was his T-shirt, pants, shoes and most importantly: His willingness to leave his comfort zone.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Digital RGB LED guide</title><link href="/tech/2018/08/07/digital-rgb-led-guide.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Digital RGB LED guide" /><published>2018-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-08-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/tech/2018/08/07/digital-rgb-led-guide</id><content type="html" xml:base="/tech/2018/08/07/digital-rgb-led-guide.html">&lt;p&gt;I need LEDs, a lot of LEDs. About 13.000 for a lighting project. That should be about 1400$ worth of LED. Therefore here is the result of the research I did to prevent wasting a huge load of cash I do not have anyways.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ws2801&quot;&gt;WS2801&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ws2801.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;width: 220px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first generation of control ICs by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.world-semi.com&quot;&gt;World Semiconductor&lt;/a&gt; which requires a separate clock input additional to data (SPI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ws2811&quot;&gt;WS2811&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ws2811.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;width: 220px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the generation after the WS2801. This IC only requires data input and works with a fixed clock speed of either 400kHz or 800kHz, which might require you to save all stripe color values in a buffer in order to match the required speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ws2812&quot;&gt;WS2812&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ws2812.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;width: 220px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the name for an SMD LED package with an integrated WS2811 IC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ws2812b&quot;&gt;WS2812B&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ws2812b.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;width: 220px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the improved version of the WS2812. It has a brighter LED with a more uniform color distribution. Also it features an reverse protection circuit, which will prevent breaking the stripe when attaching the power source in the wrong order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ws2813&quot;&gt;WS2813&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ws2813.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;width: 220px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the latest version. It works just like WS2812B, but also tolerates failing pixels: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6s2MlZHnC8&quot;&gt;see video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://playground.boxtec.ch/doku.php/led/ledpixel_guide&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sk6812&quot;&gt;SK6812&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SK6812 is a clone of the WS2812, that is completely compatible. It’s PWM frequency is twice that of the WS2812B which should result in less flickering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2016/03/09/the-sk6812-another-intelligent-rgb-led/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;apa102&quot;&gt;APA102&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These LEDs are designed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://neon-world.com/en/&quot;&gt;APA Electronic co. LTD&lt;/a&gt;. They don’t show any visible PWM flicker when moving the LED due to a very high modulation frequency (19.2 kHz). The full brighness setting (31) should be used to reduce flicker. It was tested running with 60MHz SPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/apa102/&quot;&gt;source 1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pjrc.com/why-apa102-leds-have-trouble-at-24-mhz/&quot;&gt;source 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sk9822&quot;&gt;SK9822&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are a clone of the APA102. Unfortunately it has a slightly different behaviour regarding it’s protocol since every frame will be displayed on receiving the next start frame. That results in updating all LEDs at once unlike with the APA102 or WS28XX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/sk9822-a-clone-of-the-apa102/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;voltage-drop&quot;&gt;Voltage drop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to overcome voltage drop with long LEDs strips a higher voltage is better. Otherwise power injection every couple meters will be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I decided to purchase the WS2812, because when ordering a lot of LEDs the price difference is very noticeable. (1680€ vs. 1050€) The data speed of 800 kBit/s is enough to run 4 meters of stripe with 60 frames per second. To me the missing features of reverse polarity protection and tolerating failing pixels isn’t worth almost twice the price if you compare WS2812 to WS2813. Also the lower PWM frequency is acceptable since the object and the viewer won’t move around very fast. Also the external resistor next to every LED is a downside compared to WS2813. 🦄🔥&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="tech" /><category term="led" /><category term="lighting" /><summary type="html">I need LEDs, a lot of LEDs.

&lt;p&gt;Combining some Python scripting and GitLab-CI configs results in a nice pipeline that processes LaTeX documents automatically while enforcing a certain folder structure. No more garbage and no more pain. Find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline&quot;&gt;example repo here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;The working &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline/pipelines&quot;&gt;GitLab CI pipeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gitlab-ci.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitLab CI pipeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;The script output&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gitlab-ci-out.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;The uploaded resulting artifacts &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline/-/jobs/57720189/artifacts/browse&quot;&gt;accessible in GitLab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gitlab-ci-artifacts.png&quot; alt=&quot;accessible in GitLab&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;email&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For emailing a document for example to your tutors the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline/blob/master/scripts/pipeline/latexpipeline.py&quot;&gt;scripts/pipeline/latexpipeline.py&lt;/a&gt; submodule will parse the commit message and search for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--final&lt;/code&gt; flag. In our example the commit message&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Add my assignment no 5 --final assignment_papers/documentfoldername --comment Sorry for my late submission, it will not happen again! 😇💋
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;would result in an raw text email being sent to the recipient specified in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline/blob/master/scripts/pipeline_script.py&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scripts/pipeline_script.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the email of the GitLab User being CCed as Reply-To.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;The mail being sent to the address defined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline/blob/master/scripts/pipeline_script.py&quot;&gt;scripts/pipeline_script.py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gitlab-ci-mail.png&quot; alt=&quot;scripts/pipeline_script.py&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;telegram-and-iftt&quot;&gt;Telegram and IFTT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little help by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com&quot;&gt;IFTTT.com&lt;/a&gt; it’s very easy to integrate Telegram notifications into the system using a bot. One benefit is certainly shaming users into testing their TeX files before submitting them knowing that their utter failure will be public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;Exemplary Telegram notifications about successes and failures&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gitlab-ci-telegram.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;The applets for the bachelorprojects Telegram group including the Webhook based applet forwarding messages to the Telegram bot.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gitlab-ci-ifttt.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-short-intro-to-gitlab-ci&quot;&gt;A short intro to GitLab CI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/README.html&quot;&gt;GitLab CI&lt;/a&gt; is like any other continuous integration platform with the additional feature of &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pipelines/job_artifacts.html&quot;&gt;job artifacts&lt;/a&gt;. This means a job can produce files as output that will be stored and and can be directly linked to on the GitLab platform. Of course this is ideal for our LaTeX pipeline. Let’s take a look at the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;compile_pdf&lt;/code&gt; stage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;compile_pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;compile_pdf&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;before_script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;rm -rf htmlcov&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;python3 scripts/pipeline_script.py run &quot;$GITLAB_USER_NAME&quot; $CI_JOB_ID &quot;$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)&quot; $GITLAB_USER_EMAIL $CI_PROJECT_URL&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;single_pdfs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;paths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;assignment_papers/latex_output&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;letters/latex_output&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;artifacts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;paths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;assignment_papers/*.pdf&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;letters/*.pdf&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First it executes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline/blob/master/scripts/pipeline_script.py&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scripts/pipeline_script.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; script. The necessary arguments are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/variables/README.html&quot;&gt;GitLab variables&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$GITLAB_USER_NAME&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$CI_JOB_ID&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$GITLAB_USER_EMAIL&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$CI_PROJECT_URL&lt;/code&gt; as well as the current commit message: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)&lt;/code&gt;. The executed &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline/blob/master/scripts/pipeline_script.py&quot;&gt;scripts/pipeline_script.py&lt;/a&gt; will write all files resulting from document compilation to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;assignment_papers/latex_output/*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;letters/latex_output/*&lt;/code&gt; and copy the PDFs to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;assignment_papers/*.pdf&lt;/code&gt; and `letters/*.pdf/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting the key &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cache&lt;/code&gt; results in all files specified under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;paths&lt;/code&gt; being cached between job runs given you’re using a dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/runners/README.html&quot;&gt;GitLab runner&lt;/a&gt;. Alos it will speed up compilation because documents will only be recompiled if there’s a change. In our example case it reduced the runtime from 5 minutes to just 1 minute. Unfortunately the free shared runners on gitlab.com don’t allow this. But what about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pipelines/job_artifacts.html&quot;&gt;job artifacts&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline/blob/master/scripts/pipeline_script.py&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scripts/pipeline_script.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; script will copy the resulting PDFs from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;foldername/latex_output/*pdf&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;foldername/*.pdf&lt;/code&gt;. This happens at the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PIPELINE.move_pdfs()&lt;/code&gt; function call. Thus we specify under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;artifacts&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;paths&lt;/code&gt; where GitLab CI will look for matching files to store them as artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;image-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;Processing time without caching and with enabled caching.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gitlab-ci-caching.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-the-script-do&quot;&gt;What does the script do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately after checking that the folder structures are compliant the script will execute the following lines in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline/blob/master/scripts/pipeline/latexpipeline.py&quot;&gt;scripts/pipeline/latexpipeline.py&lt;/a&gt; submodule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dir_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;second_level_items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;folderpath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;relative_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dir_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sccmsg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;errmsg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\033&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;[91mError with compiling &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\033&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;[94m{d}.tex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\033&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;[0m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;cmd: {c}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;\
                    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dir_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error_notify_and_exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;errmsg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dictionary &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;second_level_items&lt;/code&gt; contains all but the exempted subfolders in a valid root subdirectory. Now all it does for a folder called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;documentfoldername&lt;/code&gt; residing in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;assignment_papers&lt;/code&gt; is executing these commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-shell&quot; data-lang=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;documentfoldername
latexmk &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-output-directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;../latex_output &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-pdf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;documentfoldername.tex&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'$pdflatex=q/pdflatex %O -shell-escape %S/'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After executing the script will print a success message. If the command fails it will notify about this and exit with an error so that the GitLab job will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enforcing-folder-rules&quot;&gt;Enforcing folder rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline/blob/master/scripts/pipeline_script.py&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scripts/pipeline_script.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enforces a folder structure like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
|
+--assignment_papers
|  +--documentfoldername
|  |  +--figures
|  |  |  +--example.png
|  |  +--documentfoldername.tex
|  |  +--preamble.tex
|  |  +--content.tex
|  +--otherdocumentfoldername
|  |  +--figures
|  |  |  +--example.pdf
|  |  +--otherdocumentfoldername.tex
|  |  +--preamble.tex

+--letters

|  |  +--documentfoldername.tex
|  +--otherdocumentfoldername
|  |  +--figures
|  |  |  +--example.jpg
|  |  +--otherdocumentfoldername.tex
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there can be multiple folders the root directory
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;assignment_papers&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;subfolders must contain &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; files with the same name&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;subfolders must contain &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;preamble.tex&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;subfolders must contain &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;content.tex&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;subfolders may contain a figures folder&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;letters&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;subfolders must contain &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; files with the same name&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;subfolders may contain a figures folder&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rules are determined in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline/blob/master/scripts/pipeline_script.py&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scripts/pipeline_script.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FOLDER_STRUCTURES&lt;/code&gt; dictionary. It maps the root level subfolder names to folder structure rules formatted as dictionaries. For example if a subfolders name begins with a string in the list referenced by the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;exempt_dirs_start_with&quot;&lt;/code&gt; key it will be exempted from being processed by the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#dirs starting with given string in LateXPipeline.relative_path will be ignored&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#also applied to root level dirs&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;known-issues&quot;&gt;Known issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still a problem with calculating the code coverage. As seen in the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline&quot;&gt;example repo &lt;/a&gt; the displayed code coverage is just about 80% when it should be very close to 100 percent. Unfortunately the tests in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/kryptokommunist/latexpipeline/blob/master/scripts/tests/test_latexpipeline.py&quot;&gt;scripts/tests/test_latexpipeline.py&lt;/a&gt; calling the script with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subprocess.run&lt;/code&gt; won’t be measured by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;codecov&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test_console_test_usage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

Spanische Kolonie, Revolution und Kubakrise lautet die Kurzzusammenfassung. Und nun ist Kuba eines der wenigen Länder, welches sich noch der Coca-Cola-Marktwirtschaft verweigert. Es sei der Vollständigkeit halber angemerkt, dass es dennoch ein leichtes ist, auf Kuba käuflich eine Cola zu erwerben.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Die Republik Kuba wartet mit tropisch-feuchtheißem Meeresklima auf und die Hauptinsel ist 1200 Kilometer lang und zwischen 30 und 190 Kilometer breit. Insgesamt leben dort 11,2 Millionen Kubaner. Zusammen erwirtschaften sie ein BIP von 85 Milliarden USD (2015), wobei das Durchschnittseinkommen bei 29 USD liegt. Auf Kuba waren einige Werbetafeln zu sehen, welche für Demokratie und die anstehenden Wahlen warben. Das auswärtige Amt bemerkt hierzu jedoch lakonisch in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/kubasicherheit/212208&quot;&gt;den Länderinformationen&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regierungspartei:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ausschließlich zugelassen: Kommunistische Partei Kubas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opposition:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;neben der Kommunistischen Partei sind keine anderen Parteien zugelassen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dabei dürfte es sich wohl um ein diplomatische Formulierung handeln. Auch der folgende Auszug macht deutlich, wie es um die demokratische Verfassung Kubas bestellt ist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Besucher sollten politische Betätigung unterlassen, dies kann mit hohen Haftstrafen geahndet werden.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dann gibt es da noch die Sache mit den zwei Währungen &lt;a href=&quot;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubanischer_Peso&quot;&gt;CUC und CUP&lt;/a&gt;. Ein CUC (Peso convertible) ist einen US-Dollar wert, 24 CUP (Peso cubano) entsprechen 1 CUC und können nicht in Fremdwährung getauscht werden. Der CUP wird hauptsächlich zur Bezahlung staatlich subventionierter Waren benutzt und ist für die meisten Touristen folglich irrelevant. Nichtsdestoweniger ist es bemerkenswert, dass sich Kuba zwei Währungen leistet. Zwar wurde 2013 angekündigt die Währungen zusammenführen zu wollen, doch auch ich habe Leute mit CUP zahlen sehen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um die zur Einreise erforderliche Touristenkarte zu erhalten, begibt man sich zum kubanischen Konsulat in Berlin und erhält
diese nach kurzer Wartezeit. Es wiehert der Amtsschimmel. Die Räumlichkeiten selbst geben ein Vor­ge­fühl auf das Reiseland. In dem zweifelsohne noch der DDR entsprungenen Bau nimmt eine ältere Dame hinter einem hohen Tresen Gesuche entgegen und bittet auf einem der muffigen Sessel Platz zu nehmen. Das WiFi funktioniert nicht. Insgesamt eine gute Einstimmung auf Kuba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;havanna&quot;&gt;Havanna&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zeitsprung, Ortswechsel, ich bin grade am &lt;em&gt;La Habana Aeroporto&lt;/em&gt; gelandet. Von dort nehme ich ein Taxi zum Hostel. Auf der Fahrt wird bereits ersichtlich, dass Havanna eine morbide Schönheit ist. Die vielen bunten Häuser und Autos sind hübsch anzusehen. Sie scheinen ein wenig aus der Zeit gefallen und eisern dem Verfall zu trotzen. Überall sind die für Kuba bekannten Oldtimer zu sehen. Einige Modelle sehen noch aus wie neu, andere hingegen lassen ernsthaft um Sicherheit der Insassen fürchten. Was man auf den tollen Werbeprospekt-Bildchen nicht sieht, ist der zugehörige Geruch, wenn eine ganze Insel verkehrstechnisch die Siebziger-Jahre wiederaufleben lässt. Nach einer Weile gewöhnt man sich zwar an den Benzingestank, dennoch schmälert dies den Charme der bulligen Cruiser auf den Straßen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An der Adresse angekommen wundere ich mich erst einmal, wo denn das Hostel ist. An der Stelle an welcher das Hostel sein sollte sehe ich lediglich eine baufällige Ruine. Hat sich der Taxifahrer verfahren? Am winzigen Schild am Eingang erkenne ich schließlich, dass besagte &lt;del&gt;Ruine&lt;/del&gt; renovierungsbedürftige Baute meine Unterkunft für die nächsten Tage ist. In Havanna sind sehr viele Gebäude marode, dennoch wohnen Leute in den Häusern. Selbst Gebäude, die in den letzen Atemzügen liegen, werden noch bewohnt. Insofern passt das Hostel gut ins Bild, zum Glück sieht es innen deutlich besser aus. Die quirlige Hostelbesitzerin Aylin erklärt allen Gästen Kuba und was man umbedingt gesehen haben muss. Außerdem beklagt sie, dass sie für den ganzen Monat lediglich 30 Stunden Internetzugang erhält. Dennoch kostet es 50 &lt;a href=&quot;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peso_convertible&quot;&gt;CUC&lt;/a&gt;, was etwa 50 Euro entspricht. Der einschlägige Telekom-Manager dürfte hier eine Freudenträne nicht unterdrücken können.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Sozialismus trifft auf spanische Kolonialzeit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geht man vor die Tür, fällt dem deutschen Auge sofort eine ungewohnte Gelassenheit der Menschen auf. Die Menschen gehen gelassen durch die Stadt und hetzen nicht. Das Leben findet auf der Straße statt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicht vergessen darf man den obligatorischen Besuch des Revolutionsmuseums in welchem die Befreiung Kubas durch Fidel Castro und Che Guevara als &lt;del&gt;Musical&lt;/del&gt; Ausstellung dargeboten wird. Das Museum selbst ist –  wie so vieles hier – in einem Dämmerzustand gefangen. Zersprungene Fenster, Farbkleckse auf dem Boden, Baugerüste und sogar arbeitende Maler verteilen sich im Museum. Dennoch strahlt das Gebäude eine Grandezza aus, welche von der bedeutsamen Historie zeugt. Die spanischen Kolonialherren, der Diktator Batista und schließlich Fidel Castro selbst nutzten das Gebäude als Regierungssitz. Teile des Gebäudes lassen noch immer erahnen, wie prunkvoll es sich hier einst gelebt haben lassen musste. Der Museumsabschnitt, welcher die Zeit nach der Revolution behandelt, berichtet nüchtern von der Verstaatlichung der amerikanischen Unternehmen und der politisch Linke Teil in mir freut sich heimlich etwas. Darüber hinaus findet die CIA viel unrühmliche Erwähnung, Dengue-Fieber-Epidemien, Schweinepest, Nutztierseuchen und Angriffe auf Plantagen soll sie laut Ausstellung zu verantworten haben. Auch wenn die CIA eindeutig &lt;a href=&quot;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mongoose&quot;&gt;Sabotagepläne verfolgt hat&lt;/a&gt;, bleibt fraglich ob es soweit ging gezielt &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/06/world/epidemic-in-cuba-sets-off-dispute-with-us.html&quot;&gt;Krankheiten zu verbreiten&lt;/a&gt;. Dafür und für die Schweinebuchtinvasion gibt es dann am Ausgang auch die bei Besuchern populäre US-Präsidenten-Karikaturen (+ Batista).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im Außenbereich finden sich Artefakte aus der Geschichte Kubas. Neben dem Boot auf dem Castro vor der erfolgreichen Revolution mit nur 50 Männern übersetzte findet sich auch allerlei vermischtes. So hat es das Triebwerk eines abgeschossenen U2-Spionageflugzeugs der Amerikaner in den Geschichtspark geschafft. Soldaten in strenger Uniform wachen über die Besucher und greifen bei Betreten des Rasens beherzt zur revolutionären Trillerpfeife. Alles in allem hat der Mythos Revolution an Glanz eingebüßt, die “Che Guevara”-Wachsfigur kann nicht den maroden Zustand Kubas vergessen machen. Ob dies als Narrativ stark genug ist, um die Menschen vom Aufbegehren und den Versuchungen des Kapitalismus abzuhalten wird die Zukunft zeigen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doch was sagen eigentlich die Kubaner zu all dem? Ein junger Kubaner, welcher an der Universität in Havanna studiert möchte umbedingt Kuba verlassen und erzählt, dass er lediglich nach einem Arbeitgeber sucht, welcher ihm den Umzug finanziert. Mit dem vorherrschenden System scheint er wenig anfangen zu können. Er erklärt, dass es hier normal sei, dass ein Taxifahrer mehr verdient als ein Arzt. Dies deckt sich mit Aussagen aus Reiseführern in welchen beschrieben steht, dass hinter vielen kubanischen Ärzten und Professoren, Burgerbrater und Putzkräfte im Ausland stehen, welche mit ihren Geldüberweisungen die geistige Landeselite querfinanzieren. Die Limitierung auf 200 Megabyte Internet pro Woche für Studierende ist sicherlich ebenfalls ein Problem. In ganz Havanna gibt es aktuell nur 60 WIFI-Hotspots des staatlichen Internetproviders. Dort versammeln sich die Menschen für die tägliche Dosis Netz. Auch die langen Schlangen vor den Internetkartenläden zeugen von einem digitalen Versorgungsmangel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zufälligerweise treffe ich einen der Maintainer des kubanischen &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-8740-the_internet_in_cuba_a_story_of_community_resilience&quot;&gt;Internetersatzes SNET&lt;/a&gt;. Neben &lt;a href=&quot;http://paquetedecuba.com&quot;&gt;El paquete&lt;/a&gt; – bestehend aus Festplatten welche wöchentlich aktualisiert und geteilt werden, stellt &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/de/article/mg7ddx/kubanische-jugendliche-bauen-ihrem-land-ein-unabhaengiges-intranet-555&quot;&gt;SNET&lt;/a&gt; einen weiteren Weg dar, um Daten zu teilen. Dies erfolgt ohne Internetzugang in einem lokalen &lt;a href=&quot;https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad-hoc-Netz&quot;&gt;Mesh-Netzwerk&lt;/a&gt;. Dieser erzählt auch von allerhand Problemen mit technischer Infrastruktur und den findigen Workarounds. Auch erfahre ich, dass die Kubaner ihre Kommunikationsdaten zur weitergehenden Analyse vermutlich an die Russen weitergeben. Die Frage warum Kubas Internetversorgung zu den schlechtesten der Welt gehört bleibt jedoch unklar. Angst vor Oppositions oder schlicht Ignoranz und Ressourcenmangel könnten Gründe sein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;varadero&quot;&gt;Varadero&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Die Touristenhochburg Varadero liegt drei Stunden Autofahrt östlich von Havanna. Hier finden sich karibischer Katalogsandstrand und eine Reihe von All-Inclusive-Bunkern, die sich wie an einer Perlenkette aufgeschnürt um die Strände Varaderos legen. Der lokalen Bevölkerung von 20.000 Menschen stehen jährlich 1.000.000 Besucher gegenüber. Für das gute Karma übernachte ich in einer &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_particular&quot;&gt;Casa Particular&lt;/a&gt;. Für 35 CUC pro Nacht bietet die Wohnung neben einer Dusche, welche eine Art elektrischer Stuhl darstellt auch sonst wenig erfreuliches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neben all dem Disneyland-Charme eines Tourismusortes versöhnt die wunderschöne Natur – dort wo sie erhalten wurde – schnell. Am Ende der Halbinsel auf welcher Varadero liegt, besteht ein Naturschutgebiet mit Wäldern und Höhlen, welche man erkunden kann. In den Höhlen nisten Fledermäuse, zudem gibt es teilweise tausende Jahre alte Malereien von den Ureinwohnern sowie den afrikanischen Sklaven. So ganz ohne Internet in einer Höhle auf Kuba kommt selbst der pathologischste Internettroll zur Ruhe. Die Natur wirkt wie ein angenehmes Sedativum gegen die moderne Smartphone-, Newsfeed- und Pushnotification-Welt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alles in allem ist Kuba einen Besuch wert. Wenn man nicht nur im touristischen Paralleluniversum am Sandstrand bleibt, gibt es auf Kuba viel zu entdecken. Dies kann auch die ein oder andere Lebensmittelvergiftung nicht schmälern. Leider habe ich die Größe Kubas völlig unterschätzt. Man sollte genug Zeit einplanen, um die ganze Insel zu entdecken. Hinzu kommt, dass das Leben recht teuer ist, da der Staat die Wirtschaft kontrolliert und Tourismus eine wichtige Einahmequelle ist. Einfach in einen Supermarkt zu gehen und selbst etwas zu kochen ist nicht so einfach. Dies hat sich bemerkbar gemacht, als ich danach in Mexico (freie Marktwirtschaft + keine Insel) war und festellen musste, dass ich dort viel länger Leben könnte, ohne dass eine Pleite droht. Auf Kuba lagen die Lebenshaltungskosten bei circa 42 Euro pro Tag. Auch fiel auf, dass auf Kuba zwar ein niedrigerer Lebensstandard als in Mexico-City herrscht, aber auf Kuba niemand auf der Straße um Geld gebettelt hat. Die Frage wäre ob dies nun Sozialismus oder strikterem Vorgehen gegen Bettler zuzuschreiben ist. Kuba wird nach dem Abdanken Raul Castros in diesem Jahr sich womöglich öffnen und ein anderes Kuba werden, als jenes, das ich erleben durfte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuba ist sehr schön und es gibt für Besucher einen faktischen Internetzölibat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="travel" /><category term="travel" /><category term="kuba" /><category term="Havanna" /><category term="Varadero" /><summary type="html">Ein Touristen-VISA für einen Kubaaufenthalt zu bekommen ist nicht schwer, der Tourismus ist eine feste Devisenquelle für die kleine Karibische Insel mit seiner so wilden Vergangenheit. Spanische Kolonie, Revolution und Kubakrise lautet die Kurzzusammenfassung. Und nun ist Kuba eines der wenigen Länder, welches sich noch der Coca-Cola-Marktwirtschaft verweigert. Es sei der Vollständigkeit halber angemerkt, dass es dennoch ein leichtes ist, auf Kuba käuflich eine Cola zu erwerben. Die Republik Kuba wartet mit tropisch-feuchtheißem Meeresklima auf und die Hauptinsel ist 1200 Kilometer lang und zwischen 30 und 190 Kilometer breit. Insgesamt leben dort 11,2 Millionen Kubaner. Zusammen erwirtschaften sie ein BIP von 85 Milliarden USD (2015), wobei das Durchschnittseinkommen bei 29 USD liegt. Auf Kuba waren einige Werbetafeln zu sehen, welche für Demokratie und die anstehenden Wahlen warben. Das auswärtige Amt bemerkt hierzu jedoch lakonisch in den Länderinformationen: Regierungspartei: ausschließlich zugelassen: Kommunistische Partei Kubas Opposition: neben der Kommunistischen Partei sind keine anderen Parteien zugelassen</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Indien oder jedenfalls ein winziger Teil davon</title><link href="/travel/2017/04/21/indien-oder-jedenfalls-ein-winziger-teil-davon.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Indien oder jedenfalls ein winziger Teil davon" /><published>2017-04-21T18:31:20+00:00</published><updated>2017-04-21T18:31:20+00:00</updated><id>/travel/2017/04/21/indien-oder-jedenfalls-ein-winziger-teil-davon</id><content type="html" xml:base="/travel/2017/04/21/indien-oder-jedenfalls-ein-winziger-teil-davon.html">&lt;p&gt;Größte Demokratie der Welt, Schwellenland, G20, Kolonialherrschaft, Ghandi. Man verbindet viele Begriffe mit Indien. Doch dass diese letztlich nur ein schwaches Schlaglicht auf das in jeder Hinsicht enorme Land werfen, ist klar. Wie der Zufall es will, hat es mich unlängst für 7 Tage nach Indien verschlagen. Nein, ich habe nicht in einem Radiogewinnspiel gewonnen, aber es spielte sich in etwa ähnlich ab. Hauptgrund der Reise war der Flugpreis von 200 Euro, da es sich um eine sogenannte Errorfare handelte. Also keine hochtrabenden Weltendeckerambitionen, Selbstfindungsfantasien oder ungestüme Abenteuerlust – schlicht schnöde weltlicher Ökonomismus. Daher folgt eine kleine Abhandlung über Indien in 7 Tagen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohne allzu viel Vorbereitung – positiver Formuliert könnte man auch ohne Voreingenommenheit sagen – ging es daher eines Freitags los. Im Vorhinein habe ich mir zugegeben wahrlich nicht allzu viele Gedanken gemacht, lediglich ein kleines, aber feines Buch von Bernard Imhasly mit dem naheliegenden Titel Indien diente der Vorbereitung. Indiens Geschichte ist eine komplexe Materie. So war ich etwas überrascht und irgendwie doch auch nicht, dass laut Autor das Land Indien eine Illusion sei. Vielmehr handelt es sich bei Indien um eine Vielzahl von Völkern, die wie so häufig in der früheren Geschichte einmal von ihren Kolonialherren zusammengelegt wurden. Nachdem aber die Selbstständigkeit Indiens etabliert wurde – Ghandi, wir erinnern uns – schlug sich dies nicht nur in der Abspaltung Pakistans, sondern auch in einer im hohen Maße föderalen Staatsstruktur nieder. Noch heute gibt es Probleme mit SIM-Karten, wenn man den Bundesstaat wechselt. Aber wir wollen uns nicht zu lange mit profanen Fakten beschäftigen. Es folgt nun viel der erste Akt “Ankunft in Mumbai”:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schon beim Anflug auf Mumbai fallen dem aufmerksamen Beobachter, wie auch dem artverwandten unaufmerksamen Beobachter, die bis direkt an die Landebahn angrenzenden Hütten auf. “Nanu” wundert sich der Westler, jetzt offenbart diese Stadt einem schon Slumdog-Millionaire-Anspielungen und denkt an romantische Slum-Eintracht und das ewig währende Märchen vom Aufstiegskampf. Bin ich jetzt überhaupt darauf vorbereitet? Will ich das alles nicht erst einmal aus der Ferne und wenn überhaupt dann am letzten Tag sehen? Aber so ist Mumbai nicht, ohne falsche Zurückhaltung schleudert es dem Besucher ab Tag Eins alles entgegen, was es aufzubieten vermag – und das ist viel. Romantische Anwandlungen verfliegen schnell. Man sieht allenthalben, dass Indien ein Schwellenland ist. Die Wellblechhütte grenzt direkt an Prachtbauten, Familien schlafen auf der Straße, während andere sich im nicht unwerten Rolex-Store verlustieren. Das ist vor allem einmal eine große Reizüberflutung, der Verkehr ist aberwitzig. Schnell muss man lernen seinen Weg durch das Chaos zu finden. Die ersten Tage ist jeder Wechsel der Straßenseite eine kleine Mutprobe. Während man selbst mit sich hadert, zetert und zaudert, geht der Inder lässig ohne großes überlegen durch den Verkehr, den Autofahrern die Handinnenfläche entgegenstreckend. Solche Szenen haben fast eine mystische Komponente, so wie ehedem Jesus das Meer teilte, teilt nun Sunjai den Verkehr. Toll denke ich, während ich dem indischen Jesus hinterhereile. Auch eine neue Spielregel, die ich verinnerlichen musste, war die Tatsache, dass im indischen Straßenverkehr die Hupe eher wie ein Martinshorn genutzt wird. Dies resultiert natürlich in ein fortwährendes, dysharmonisches Hupkonzert. Sieht man Fußgänger vor sich, überholt man ein anderes Fahrzeug, kündigt man sich mit einem kurzen Hupton an. Dies scheint auch relativ gut zu funktionieren, jedenfalls habe ich keinen einzigen Unfall miterlebt, obwohl der chaotische Verkehr die ständige Erwartung eines Unglücks forciert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aber auch das Zugfahren unterscheidet sich nicht unbeträchtlich von der gewohnten europäischen Art. Es fängt damit an, dass in Zügen die Türen prinzipiell offen bleiben. Das was das Zugfahren prinzipiell erst einmal auch angenehmer gestalten kann – je nach Mut kann man sich mehr oder weniger weit aus der Tür lehnen – deckt natürlich auch ein diametrales Sicherheitsdenken auf. Bauarbeiter, welche barfüßig mit schwerem Gerät arbeiten, Leute die auf dem Gleisbett gehen, abenteuerliche Baukonstruktionen: Vielerorts schüttelt man als jemand, der westlich sozialisiert wurde erschrocken den Kopf. Mumbai ist eine extrem dicht besiedelte Stadt, was dazu führt, dass die kleinen Hütten in jede freie Stelle gebaut werden. Teilweise unter Bahnbrücken, ineinander verschachtelt und auch übereinander gestapelt. An einer S-Bahn-Haltestelle sehe ich eine Hütte, die halb Zelt, halb Hütte ist. Fast erinnert es ein wenig an eine Unterkunft in einem Freizeitcamp. Doch man darf sich nicht täuschen, natürlich ist dies schlicht auch eine Folge der bitteren Armut. Viele Hütten haben zwar Strom – woher ist eine andere Frage – ihnen fehlt es jedoch an Zugang zu Kanalisation und Wasserversorgung. Grade die Kinder mit Müttern, die auf offener Straße schlafen sind ein bedrückendes Bild, welches sich ins Gedächtnis brennt. Auch die kleinen Mädchen, welche am Bahnhof Essen verkaufen und Männer, Frauen, Greise mit Behinderungen, welche am Bahnhof sitzen, liegen, betteln lassen einen tiefen Eindruck zurück. Ich habe mich geschämt für meinen Reichtum, für den Reichtum den die entwickelte Welt hat während es hier Menschen so elendig schlecht geht. Da stellt sich einem schon die Frage, mit welcher moralischen Begründung wir diesen Menschen unseren Lebensstandard vorenthalten und ob unser Lebensstandard überhaupt möglich wäre, wenn er hier ebenso vorherrschte. Ich habe keine zufriedenstellende gefunden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Die ersten Tage kommen wir zeitgemäß via AirBnB in einem kleinen, feinen Appartement im zentralen Stadtteil Colaba unter. Die Wohnung gehört einer Inderin, welche aber erzählt, dass sie die meiste Zeit in Großbritannien lebt, weil sie es in Indien nicht lange aushält. Als ich Abends sichtlich von Mumbai überfordert in die Wohnung komme, schwärmt sie von Dänemark (“Everything just works. It’s so clean!”) und berichtet auch von London (“It’s also a bit dirty. I prefer Kopenhagen.”). Außerdem ist sie seit 10 Jahren in Mumbai nicht mehr mit dem Zug gefahren, weil es ihr zu eng und chaotisch ist. Ich fühle mich verstanden, als ich dann jedoch erfahre, dass sie mit einer zwanghaften Persönlichkeitsstörung diagnostiziert ist, schlägt das Verbundenheitsgefühl in leichte Selbstzweifel um. Aha, deshalb ist ihre Wohnung so sauber! Man fühlt sich ein wenig fehlplatziert in der keimfreien, katalogreifen Wohnung. Auch allgemein ist es ein Phänomen, dass in Indien die Innenräume penibel sauber gehalten werden. Man würde fast meinen, dass ein Kausalzusammenhang zwischen diesem Umstand und dem Dreck auf der Straße besteht. Wer seine Wohnung so sauber hält, kann das ja nicht auch noch für die Straße ebenso sicherstellen. Das obig erwähnte Indienbüchlein bemerkt hierzu, dass dies auch religiöse Gründe habe. Die Natur werde nicht wie etwa im Christentum als zu bewahrende Schöpfung gesehen, sondern vielmehr als etwas, dass in der Hand der Götter liegt. Exemplarisch wird hierfür ist der Ganges angeführt, der schon einige erfolglose Reinigungsvorhaben hinter sich hat, die am fehlenden Rückhalt und Bewusstsein scheiterten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Die Küche in Mumbai ist vegetarisch dominiert und sehr herzhaft und außerordentlich soßenreich. Mal abgesehen von den studentenfreundlichen Preisen – wir haben selbst in teureren Lokalitäten nie mehr als 10 Euro p.P. gezahlt – zeichnet sie sich durch ihre reichhaltige Vielfalt aus. Oft kommt ein Gericht sekundiert von einem Pulk an Soßen und Beilagen, sodass man als simpler Amateuresser oft bereits von Anfang an als Verlierer in die Schlacht zieht. Spätestens bei dem Menü inklusive Bathura-Flatrate ist eine Grenze des Möglichen überschritten. Auch im Restaurant findet sich die omnipräsente Spiritualität wieder, wenn sich plötzlich müde Rauchschwaden behäbig durch das Lokal walzen und in gravitätischem Ernst einer der vielen Gottheiten huldigen. Fast gleicht es dem Vorgang des Insektizidversprühens bei der Ein- und Ausreise in der Passagierkabine. Da heißt es man müsse Vorschriften beachten, vielleicht ja auch nur ein Opfer für die Götter, damit der Flug unter der Ägide Krishnas kein jähes Ende findet. Kurz gesagt, wer nach Indien reist, wird nicht verhungern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;to be continued&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indien erscheint Europäern sehr laut und chaotisch.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="travel" /><category term="travel" /><category term="india" /><summary type="html">Größte Demokratie der Welt, Schwellenland, G20, Kolonialherrschaft, Ghandi.

Es ist schwer festzumachen, jedenfalls kommt es wahrscheinlich durch die andere Küche zustande. Generell bemerkt man verschiedenste Gerüche, wenn man auf den Straßen unterwegs ist. Mir fielen sie eher unangnehm auf, aber auch hier zeigt sich, wie adaptiv das menschlichen Gehirn ist: Rund 4 Tage später bemerke ich davon fast nichts mehr. Die ersten zwei Tage verlaufen im Zeitraffer und bestehen in der Hauptsache aus holprigen Orientierungsversuchen. Beginnen wir daher doch bei Tag 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zusammen mit einer Freundin, die ich aus Berlin kenne, sollte es heute auf den ikonischen Berggipfel gehen. Quasi das Zuckerhutäquivalent Hong Kongs. Die Kabelbahnfahrt auf den Gipfel und zurück mutete wie eine Slowmotion-Achterbahnfahrt an. Furchtsame Gemüter wie ich können bei den gefühlt vertikalen Streckenabschnitten auf ihre Kosten kommen, insbesondere bei der Talfahrt wünscht man sich ein weniger qualvolles Tempo. Oben angekommen, krankt es wie ich es aus China schon kenne an einer schamlosen Kommerzialisierung. Auf dem Gipfel mit der Aussichtsplatform kommt man direkt in einem Shoppingcenter an und muss sich über 6 Etagen über Rolltreppen an allerlei Belanglosigkeiten, wie dem obligatorischen Madame Tussauds, vorbeikämpfen, um auf die Platform zu gelangen. Dort bot sich neben einem atemberaubenden Ausblick auch eine fürs europäische Auge (noch) ungewohnte Szenerie: Nicht ohne dabei einen gewissen Stolz zum Ausdruck zu bringen, recken sich die errigierten Selfiesticks im Dutzend in die Höhe. Hier vergewissert sich der Mensch seiner selbst, das Selfie als höchste Form des Seins. Dies sind wohl die Früchte einer - jedenfalls gefühlten - Verkürzung des Lebens auf die Ökonomie und der resultierenden Gesellschaftstendenz zur stärkeren Selbstdarstellung, dachte ich mir bei diesem Anblick. Dann haben wir - natürlich - noch ein Selfie geschossen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-orig-width=&quot;498&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;750&quot; data-tumblr-attribution=&quot;selfiegods:_sTRZvyUJoCwBtrhwBP_4Q:ZpIMAq22MGL_W&quot; class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/ed52f19a0258b4c68d3b26f50fe6a02b/tumblr_o33fny7tTD1slp6zuo1_500.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;498&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;750&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure data-orig-width=&quot;500&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;281&quot; data-tumblr-attribution=&quot;realitytvgifs:VkV2eg-DgP77XwPCkyD-bA:ZjsrOx1tVW3CL&quot; class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/7ff5a4e279c8168b0a6ed66a306cd2d6/tumblr_nu344wt3qN1ql5yr7o1_500.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;500&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;281&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am Abend erhielt ich die Gelegenheit einen Blick in einen Premiumsupermarkt zu werfen, der nur Importprodukte vorhielt. Hier dürfte hauptsächlich die Landeselite und verwirrte Touristen, die sich nicht besser zu helfen wissen, ihren Wochendeinkauf erledigen. Es nimmt sich durchaus bizarr aus, wenn ein magerer Mozzarella - exakt der selbe, den es bei ALDI für moderate 70 Cent gibt - nun plötzlich über einem Preisschild liegt, welches einen maliziös anlächelt und forsch fünf Euro einfordert. Solche Preissteigerungen bei Grenzübertritt kennt man sonst vielleicht noch von Kokain. Scarface mit einem Schreibtisch voll Mozarella? Hier ist dieser Gedanke schlichtweg konsequent. Nudeln mit Barilla-Tomatensoße? Macht 10 Euro bitte. Daher begnügte ich mich mit einem bezaubernd fremdartig anmutenden Mikrowellengericht aus dem Land der Sonne. Nur 6 Euro, ein echtes Schnäppchen also. Dafür hat es dann aber auch geschmeckt, wie frisch zubereitet. Ich lerne: Mikrowelle, das kann der Japaner! Teurer ist manchmal auch wirklich besser. Außerdem: Es gibt Melonen die 70 Euro kosten, ja sie existieren wirklich. Man kann sie anfassen. Ich habe sie angefasst und es fühlt sich so an, als ob man materialisierte Glück unter seiner Handfläche hielte. Ähnlich begeistert der täglich per Luftfracht eingeflogene Mandarinenkorb für 30 Euro. Ein wahrhaftiges Highlight meiner Reise. Es lässt sich aber auch insgesamt festhalten, dass die Stadt recht teuer ist. Mit Deutschland vergleichbar, meistens sogar noch teurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatsächlich habe ich mich bisher weniger mit Historie und Politik auseinandergesetzt, sondern vermehrt mit hiesigem Nachtleben. Diesbezüglich muss insbesondere der Stadtteil Lang Kwai Fong Erwähnung finden: Hier spielt sich das Nachtleben ab. Die Stimmung ist auf den Straßen ausgelassen wie auf einem Festival. So etwas habe ich bisher noch nirgends so erlebt. Die Menschen sind alle ekstatisch und kontaktfreudig. Die klassische Einstiegsfrage lautet “From where are you?”, daraufhin folgt ein spaßiges Akzentraten. Milchbubis, die aussehen, als wären sie erst 13, sitzen hinter dem Steuer eines Lamborghinis oder anderer Fahrzeuge aus der Kategorie &amp;ldquo;Hilfe meine Eltern sind obzön reich und haben mir zweifelhafte Wertvorstellungen vermittelt&amp;rdquo;. Sie möchten einem fast Leid tun, es sind Menschen für die Geld an sich einen Selbstwert darstellt. Ich bekomme von einer Einheimischen erzählt, dass sie Bekannte hat, welche den Tick haben, beim Ausgehen jedes Mal ritualhaft ihre 100.000 Euro teuren Uhren in den geordneten Champagner tunken. Eine Anekdote, die durchaus die Frage aufwirft: Gehören diese 100.000€ wirklich an das Handgelenk eines solchen Neureichenabkömmlings oder in ein Sozialsystem, dass die ausgemergelten Senioren in den Straßengassen versorgt. Das dürfte am Ende beiden Seiten nutzen. Die einen haben Essen, die anderen mehr Realitätsnähe. Aber die Ex-Kolonie, in der Rolexläden wie hierzulande McDonalds-Geschäfte das Stadtbild prägen hat sich augenscheinlich anders entschieden. Kapitalismus fuck yeah. Bekommt man solche Exzesse in Deutschland einfach nicht so sehr mit? Oder ist die hiesige Vermögenselite schlichtweg diskreter, aber keineswegs weniger verdorben? Interessant zu wissen wäre es allemal. Sicherlich gibt es eine weiter entwickelte Kultur des Umgangs mit obszönem Wohlstand, in Asien ist dies noch ein relativ junges Phänomen der Neuzeit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-orig-width=&quot;500&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;279&quot; data-tumblr-attribution=&quot;realitytvgifs:VkV2eg-DgP77XwPCkyD-bA:ZjsrOx1PzBcom&quot; class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/eaf2e48906cb97e96141ce83885b0951/tumblr_nbcwc0G3Pe1ql5yr7o1_500.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;500&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;279&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Die Menschen im Ausgehviertel sind etwa hälftig Ausländer und ja, man trifft auch öfters auf das Exemplar des klassischen Bilderbuchsexpats. Je später der Abend wird, desto mehr Massen torkeln gen Taxischlange. An der einen Ecke lässt sich ein Amerikaner von seiner wenig begeisterten Freundin erklären, dass er sich mal vorstellen solle, sie würde vor seinen Augen mit jemand anderem flirten. An der nächsten Ecke schmeißt ein Trunkenbold frohen Mutes Gläser auf die Straße. Etwa ein halbes Dutzend Polizisten findet dies offenbar so interessant, dass sie ihm mit einem beherzten Gewalteinsatz auf seine unausgesprochene Frage &amp;ldquo;Ab welchem Grad wird Idiotie illegal&amp;rdquo; antworten. Einige Straßen weiter wird eine Alkoholeiche auf eine Trage umgelagert. Kurzum: Es ist echt was los. Ich hätte fast ein wenig Sorge im Sog des Nachtlebens zu verschwinden, wenn ich hier leben würde. Tatsächlich hat es ein wenig meine hochtrabenden Pläne mich mehr um kulturellen und historischen Kontext zu bemühen konterkariert. Wie dem auch sei, Ende Oktober werde ich noch einmal Gelegenheit dazu haben. Nächster Halt: Seoul. Ich hoffe, dass ich nach den 12 Tagen dort nicht als K-Pop-Trash ende.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-orig-width=&quot;500&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;302&quot; data-tumblr-attribution=&quot;the-devil-beside-you:Wlo0S3LTWD210pLK9rKd6w:ZQ4fvp1lwF1Vc&quot; class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/86ff2c2957f7e7a1b9fa48f02b4275b7/tumblr_novevj56GM1t0l1jvo1_500.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;500&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;302&quot;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="travel" /><category term="travel" /><category term="hong kong" /><summary type="html">[Fotos kommen später noch, es müssen erst einmal die Gifs genügen]Die eindrücklichste Wahrnehmung meines ersten Tages, war nicht die drückende Hitze, die vielen Menschen,  - nein - es war der Geruch. Es ist schwer festzumachen, jedenfalls kommt es wahrscheinlich durch die andere Küche zustande. Generell bemerkt man verschiedenste Gerüche, wenn man auf den Straßen unterwegs ist. Mir fielen sie eher unangnehm auf, aber auch hier zeigt sich, wie adaptiv das menschlichen Gehirn ist: Rund 4 Tage später bemerke ich davon fast nichts mehr. Die ersten zwei Tage verlaufen im Zeitraffer und bestehen in der Hauptsache aus holprigen Orientierungsversuchen. Beginnen wir daher doch bei Tag 3.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Es beginnt mit dem Anfang</title><link href="/travel/2016/09/06/es-beginnt-mit-dem-anfang.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Es beginnt mit dem Anfang" /><published>2016-09-06T01:14:31+00:00</published><updated>2016-09-06T01:14:31+00:00</updated><id>/travel/2016/09/06/es-beginnt-mit-dem-anfang</id><content type="html" xml:base="/travel/2016/09/06/es-beginnt-mit-dem-anfang.html">&lt;p&gt;Dies ist der Anfang, nur von was genau?

Vor zwei Jahren bin ich das letzte mal länger allein verreist, seit dem ist viel passiert. Ich habe mich verändert, die Welt hat sich verändert.

&lt;p&gt;Eine schlaue Frage, die man ziemlich allen Menschen stellen kann, die grade von einer Reise kommen lautet “Was hast du erwartet und was hast du vorgefunden?”. Ich habe noch keine genauen Erwartungen, weil ich mich wie meistens - manche werten das als stoisch (ich), andere töricht (nicht ich) - erst kurz vorher oder im Land selbst plane, was genau ich machen werde. In 6 Stunden steige ich in den Flieger. Ziel: Dem Durchschnittswestler vor allem bekannt als Jackie Chans Geburtsort: Hong Kong. Und ich weiß noch nicht wo ich unterkommen werde (Ich freue mich schon auf den nächsten “Obdachlos - Hong Kong authentisch erleben” betitelten Blogpost). Insofern kann ich noch keine Erwartungen niederschreiben, um nachher akribisch mit einem Tabellenkalkulationsprogramm* einen tabellarischen Vergleich zu ziehen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Anm. d. Red.: Dieses Wortungetüm selbst verströmt den ganzen Sexappeal der vielgeliebten MS Excel Produktreihe, der ja wohl vollkommen unstreitig ist) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wie immer vor größeren Reisen ergibt sich bei mir ein Stimmungsbild mehrerlei gegensätzlicher Gefühle. Es ist eine gewisse Angstlust, die sich breit macht. Das Vertraute verlassen und gegen Ungewissheit eintauschen einerseits, neue Erfahrungen und Perspektiven andererseits. Von einem Abenteuer zu sprechen ginge angesichts der globalisierten Welt wohl etwas zu weit, es ist nicht so, als ob ich bei der Reise ein Bein verlieren könnte (Falls doch fände ich es wahrscheinlich grade wegen dieser Zeilen immerhin durchaus mittel lustig. Wäre ne gute Geschichte für einen Diaabend. Ich kann mir bereits denken, wie aus der Unfallaufnahme ein virales Video wird: “Er schrieb, er würde nicht sein Bein verlieren. Was danach passiert ist unglaublich…”). Jedenfalls habe ich mir vorgenommen den China-Reisebericht Marco Polos zu lesen und einen Vergleich zu heute zu ziehen, ein Unterschied wie Tag und Nacht dürfte es in jedem Fall sein. Nur was sind die sicherlich auch vorhandenen Gemeinsamkeiten? Aber ich schweife ab, dazu später mehr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ich hoffe, dass ich während dieser Reise ein paar gute Geschichten zu erzählen habe. Hier werde ich sie als Chronist meiner Selbst dem geneigten Publikum darbieten. Die freudvollen wie die unliebsamen Erfahrungen, die noch weit entfernt hinter dem Horizont versteckt warten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Die glitzernden Lichter der Zivilisation funkeln verheißungsvoll. Die Strukturen menschlicher Existenz bahnen sich immer dominanter ihren Weg durch die mehr oder minder unberührte Natur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Das mystische Blau vermischt mit gelb-roten Sprenkeln der Landbahnbeleuchtung kündigt das nahende Ende der Reise an, als der Flieger mit einem festen Ruck auf dem Asphalt aufsetzt. Rollwagen, Autos und wuselnde Menschen in fahlem Scheinwerferlicht umsäumen den Flieger, der weiter ruhig seinen plastenen, gräulichen Charme verströmt. Das Licht geht an, die Türen auf. Wenn auch erst nach 15 Minuten warten. Genug Zeit um wieder anzukommen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schlaftrunken taumeln Menschen durch das Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im Nachtbus bilden die Fahrgäste eine Schicksalsgemeinschaft von kurzer Dauer, ein Federstrich in eines jeden Lebensweg, der schnell verblassen wird. Die Menschen sind müde und in freudiger Erwartung zugleich. Das nasskalte Berlin nimmt seine Kinder wieder in die Arme. Und die Kinder sind froh, sie freuen sich auf ihr in kaltes Mondlicht getauchte Zuhause. Die Straßenlaternen stehen stoisch im Spalier und Im Dunkel der Nacht werfen die Natriumdampflampen ihre gelblichen Schlaglichter auf die unvollkommen-aufregende Hauptstadt.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="poetry" /><summary type="html">Wie eine behäbige Wildente hebt der Flieger nach langem Anlauf mit zitternden Flügelspitzen vom Boden und nimmt Kurs auf die ferne Mondsilhouette.
