<h3>Overview</h3>

Anattā is an experiment in which you are invited to be playful with your identity and that of someone else. Anattā (“non-self”) is a term from Buddhist texts and practices. This experiment for two people invites you to expand the space around the fixed self and to experience that it may not be quite as solid and stable as we often assume. How does it feel to be me?

How does someone who is not me feel? How does it feel when both categories dissolve?

Experiment suggestion:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Stand with another human on each side of the mirror</li>
  <li>Position yourselves so that your faces overlap exactly</li>
  <li>steel wire</li>
  <li>Turn the dial to adjust the frequency of the light</li>
</ul>
</p>
Two-way mirror

The glass is coated with, or has been encased within, a thin and almost transparent layer of metal (window film usually containing aluminium). The result is a mirrored surface that reflects some light and is penetrated by the rest. Light always passes equally in both directions. However, when one side is brightly lit and the other kept dark, the darker side becomes difficult to see from the brightly lit side because it is masked by the much brighter reflection of the lit side.

Through that, I already discovered that I and my friends often use shame and guilt to try to control each other. After becoming aware of that I dropped a lot of these patterns. When I started on my meditative path I started with a guided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5a028RS5Ck">TWIM metta meditation</a>. During that practice after a month I accidentally dropped into the first and second <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K5ypXyF3dY">Jhana</a>, thinking I might be having a stroke. So after practicing different models, I returned to TWIM, knowing its power, since firstly loving kindness simply feels good and also many people report that it’s the faster path and that it helps avoid dark night of the soul type of episodes.</p>

<h2 id="forgiveness-practice-trauma-and-finding-a-safe-anchor-in-the-heart">forgiveness practice, trauma and finding a safe anchor in the heart</h2>

<p>This has been the second silent retreat of my life after the <a href="/meditation/jhanas/therapy/english/2023/04/20/my-first-five-day-silent-retreat-jhanas-and-alexander-technique.html">6-day silent retreat</a> with Catherine McGee at Gaia House earlier this year. On the first day everyone had to lock away their phone so for the next 10 days I’d be fully with my experience with little distractions. I started with forgiveness practice for the first three days of the retreat. That meant that I would observe all the thoughts I had throughout the day and forgive them. And I was in for a shock. The whole day my mind was thinking thoughts that were completely referring to the past. My thoughts were mainly going back to replaying situations from my childhood and school as a teenager. Silence at the dinner table due to being on a silent retreat? My mind wouldn’t care and started thinking about being in trouble because there must be some conflict at the dinner table. Looking deeper of course that was how my childhood dinner with family looked like very often. My mind did not care that I was now an adult sitting with meditators at a silent dinner table. I knew I had an at times very abusive upbringing with psychological and physical violence, but after this experience, it became very clear to me that my mind was still living in that time for the majority of the day. No wonder that I was having trouble with depressive episodes and anxiety for all my life. It was likely mostly the body-mind replaying past memories and patterns.
 During the first days of forgiveness meditation, I forgave every thought I had. I had some tears coming up at times, but was never able to really let go and cry. In hindsight, since I could totally do that after the retreat I think that some part of me was holding back and was not feeling fully safe to allow feeling the grief. At times I could also catch some suicidal thoughts, a car going by and some thought of jumping in front of it would come up. I forgave myself for that and also used some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model">IFS moves</a> to ask that part of myself for its reasons. It turned out that the part wanted to protect me from experiencing pain, which I thanked it for and explained that I have learned ways to deal with pain and stay alive. Additionally, I developed a rash around my eyes for a couple of days that probably were the result of some triggers making the body release lots of cortisol.</p>

<p>A couple of days later Delson had me switch to loving kindness practice. His presence was such that it felt like he was practicing what he was preaching. He felt very present in the moment and it felt like whatever emotion, worry, etc. I threw at him would dissipate into equanimity. Besides the technical instructions the interviews conveyed a deep sense of trust in the process and it felt like the core message was: Everything will unfold by itself, accept whatever is arising.</p>

<p><img src="/images/TWIM/heart.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption"> An excerpt from my notebook.</p>
<p> At the middle of the retreat, I started to have such fine awareness and control over my attention that I could play with it and spread it in a circle around my head, move it to any body part, and spread it across the entire body. Having this great detailed awareness of where my attention is spatially was so fun and nothing I ever experienced so strongly outside retreat. Then after some time, I would start to have trouble falling asleep. A lot of fear would come up before sleeping. The most magnificent thing I noticed there was how my consciousness would be pulled by some force into the past, some traumatic memories. I did not access them, it was just a hunch. And then I could immediately feel how attention would be pulled back to my heart. I would then invoke some metta (feeling of loving kindness) and lie in bed with warmth spreading out from the heart in my chest and I felt protected from this movement of mind trying to pull me into the past. After that experience, I was sure that I want to permanently have what Delson called a lighthouse or anchor in the heart. According to Delson that is the only kind of real safety we can have and it made a lot of sense to me. It made sense not logically, but experientally it became very clear to me that this is true and incredibly powerful and valuable.</p>

<h2 id="expanded-awareness-and-alexander-technique">expanded awareness and Alexander Technique</h2>
<p> At some point in the middle of the retreat, I figured out that I was doing everything I did with an amount of unnecessary tension. When I notice that and relax it’s the same move as taught in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Technique">Alexander Technique</a> class. Only that I rediscovered it by myself as a byproduct of meditation. If I relax in that way my spine extends, my shoulders broaden and my awareness widens. It was obvious that the form of the body and that of consciousness are directly linked, in everyday life I just often lack the fine-tuned perception to catch it. I could very clearly notice how I had the habit of making myself small by tensing up and that I could just relax instead. My awareness of my body increased by a factor of ten. I felt like my upper body was noticeably bigger than how I felt it in everyday life before. I learned a motion indescribable by words where I could relax in a way that my neck would get long and it felt like it grew 10cm even though I know that was physically not the case but the feeling was such. It was like I learned to un-tense into confidence. The first couple times it felt like my shoulders are in the wrong place, above where they were supposed to be. But that was just my habit of making myself small. In my teacher interview, I asked if permanent expanded awareness was something I would get from continuing the practice. Delson told me that this was not the ultimate goal but a side effect. I could see how in my experience I would get triggered and my awareness would be contracted. And how ultimately healing and meditation are intertwined in that staying in expanded awareness is a result of healing or having integrated most triggers.</p>

<p class="caption"> An excerpt from my notebook.</p>

<h2 id="deepening-practice-and-insight">deepening practice and insight</h2>

<p>During my sits, I would just think of a spiritual friend at the start to invoke metta. I did that for a while and the metta got stronger and stronger. At some point, it got so strong that I would always get a bright flickering white light after sitting for a while. At some point, I was given the instructions to radiate the metta into six directions from my head. I proceeded to do so. This felt different. The metta felt more tranquil and from my understanding was Jhana four. I radiated it to all six directions and at the same time followed the instruction to just let the meditation happen instead of trying to meditate. It was kinda like radiating a white flickering fog out of my head, kinda like when you are on an airplane and you fly through a cloud and look out the window. I could notice how I was focusing on the feeling of metta radiating and then some tension in my body arose and I would just relax it. On one day when I felt like it was the deepest I ever got in meditation, I could see how there were tension knots in my body and then they would bubble upwards into my head where a little bubble would pop, and then in its place a thought would appear. I could see how thoughts were directly caused by the tensions in my body. That felt very trippy and since I was completely sober it’s harder to dismiss than a psychedelic experience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/TWIM/thoughts.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption"> An excerpt from my notebook.</p>

<p>Also at some point in meditation, I was just watching how the meditation was happening, I was watching how something that was not me was relaxing tensions in my field of awareness. Then relaxing that one tension would reconfigure the whole tension pattern and like solving a puzzle something would relax another tension knot. All of that was just happening by itself. It felt like I was watching the mind or consciousness like my core learning algorithm executing. Was that happening all the time on the low level and I just never looked so deep into what was going on? Since I was not able to see this deep after retreat again this experience has been hard to integrate.</p>

<p>Some other finer points of consciousness and meditation I learned. First I asked Delson if I should stop looking for blockages, hidden grief etc. and his answer was that I should let everything just come up by itself. Also that I should watch for what the intention behind looking for blockages is, if it is aversion I should beware. Then there are constructive jhanas as in invoking them by using metta or concentration and deconstructive jhanas as in if I simply relaxed I would end up in a jhanic state at some point without trying to get there. I asked Delson about how therapy is replacing one tension pattern with another whereas the TWIM meditation is just relaxing it fully and he confirmed that this is the case. Also, he said that it is not necessary to be fully aware of what I am letting go of. There will always be some tensions, just accept them. Also what I found interesting was how during the interviews Delson would sometimes look away and look back at me when I would un-tense. It seemed like he was somehow rewarding me nonverbally for un-tensing which I found interesting.</p>

<h2 id="metta-circle-and-feeling-the-intimacy-of-the-moment">metta circle and feeling the intimacy of the moment</h2>

<p>Another great experience at the retreat was the metta circle on one of the last days led by Delson’s assistants. The idea was that we would sit in a group of about 15 in a circle and one of us would sit in the middle and then everyone would close their eyes and send loving kindness to the person in the middle. That was huge for me. I was a bit skeptical if I could feel it or let the love in. But when it was my turn and I sat in the middle I noticed I was trying to receive the metta and just relaxed. At some point, my visual field just lit up with bright light and I wasn’t doing anything. I did not put in any effort and it felt like and the metta was stronger than in many of my sits. This was a huge eye-opener for me and I realised that I could just do the same thing in my sits, fully receiving the metta instead of efforting to create it. Also, this gentle, respectful way of showering someone with love opened my eyes to how in my everyday life I always thought I had to do something to show love and affection when actually it was also possible in this incredibly gentle way. I also remember that sometimes I would feel lonely and miss my friends, but just sitting with tea in the dining hall in the presence of another retreatant would dissolve it, it was great to be able to appreciate this subtle feeling of togetherness and connection without any words. These encounters revealed the intimacy of everyday moments that normally would have gone past me.</p>

<h2 id="feeling-the-calling-of-the-dharma">feeling the calling of the dharma</h2>

<p>Also on the last day the noble-silence was ended for everyone. I could feel how that brought up some social anxiety and how interacting with others would bring up more triggers and I could feel how it required booting up some sense of self for me. Everyone was incredibly diverse and I talked to a bunch of folks and what struck me was how it seemed that the longer folks practiced the more themselves and normal they seemed to me. Somehow it correlated with how much they dared to be themselves. I somehow had this image in my mind that the advanced practitioners would fit some peaceful and serene image of Buddhist monks. It was hugely inspiring that they seemed like normal folks. Also, I could tell that those who had a lot of practice were somehow easy to talk to and it was like spending time with them was transmitting some openness and easefullness effortlessly. To me, it seemed like I was being drawn in by that and it was the dharma speaking to me and inviting me to go further. What stuck in my mind was that someone told me “If you give to the dharma, the dharma will give to you”. The whole experience was amazing, there were these humans that I just met 10 days ago and they were all so loving and kind to me. It felt like they were all my friends. It resembled some memories from my techno clubbing days in Berlin where with the help of MDMA in the after hour everyone was also exceptionally open and friendly with each other. But here on the retreat, it felt more heartfelt and genuine than the chemical kindness of MDMA. But there were similarities, just pointing out how great and beautiful the world looked to each other all the time and being all smiles. Also I could glimpse how powerfully different it is to see the world where everyone is my friend by default and I could see that it is possible to see the world that way through practice.</p>

<p>Still, I sensed that underneath all the metta was still some fundamental fear present in me. Going out in the world was like seeing everything for the first time. I looked at everyone’s faces and when I sat for meditation I could just go to the first or fourth Jhana in a couple minutes which was amazing. And it felt like I could do this even while walking or sitting somewhere not formally meditating. Sitting at the airport all the kindness from the folks at the retreat hit me and I cried for an entire hour during a sit. I felt that the world and people were good and kind and that I had this image of humans as inherently dangerous learned from my abusive upbringing that was just not true. I realised that love and kindness could feel this good and safe and that I probably hadn’t experienced that in a group so immediately in this way before. I felt enormous gratitude.</p>

<h2 id="post-retreat-integration">post-retreat integration</h2>

<p>After the retreat, I became aware of how my mind lives in the past further, which seems almost funny, like thoughts looping after getting up about not wanting to get up, because I do not want to go to school. But the school my mind thinks it’s going to is the school I went to as a teenager. I had to explain to this part of me that I would never have to go to this school again. Then a couple of days later after the retreat ended I had a sit in front of a mirror and I experimented with sending myself love while looking into my own eyes. I noticed that when I do the Alexander Technique move of relaxing my body such that I become taller and wider and additionally keep attention in my eyes I started crying. My eyes felt painful, like a burning sensation which from my understanding might be resistance to feeling grief. I kept feeling it and cried for an hour during that sit. After that, the doors to grief were wide open. I cried every day, more after my sits during walks that lasted an hour up to three hours for the next weeks. It got pretty intense, I could catch glimpses of thoughts around this. That grief must be decade-old grief that I was never allowed to feel as a child. After a couple of weeks of that, I could also sense some feeling of hopelessness and even suicidal thoughts at times. I just noticed them and tried to send those parts of me love and compassion. The thing that ultimately stopped those thoughts from coming up again was a ketamine therapy I started later. While ultimately beneficial for my life I have to mention that it did destabilize my life for a couple of weeks. Paradoxically feeling safer in my own heart allowed me to make more risky decisions in changing my life and that kinda of led to more instability and change. So from the outside, it looked like I was in a worse place while it was reflecting the truth of where I always have been more honestly. Still, I learned that the retreat probably reduced some amount of dissociation considerably and that led to feeling that my life was out of alignment with my true needs and wants. That can be quite disturbing, but I kept trusting my heart and followed its advice. During sits, I could now discern between when my mind would answer and when my heart would answer, when in doubt I would listen to my heart.
 Also, there were some other consequences. With my master’s thesis, I started to write my one-page expose and I just felt how uninterested I was in the whole topic I chose. I realised that with my job and thesis topic, I chose things by that others considered them to be great. But these things actually for me were out of alignment with my true interests. And while there were fun sides to going to work, I dreaded doing the work, and then just went into a Jhana state at times, which made the work more pleasant. But over the long run, I couldn’t pretend to like something I did not like. Also, I was dealing with feeling through hours of grief each day and just did not have any energy left for doing much else except meeting friends and getting support to stay afloat. In hindsight, I should have planned two or three months of downtime after the retreat for integration.</p>

<p>The same with friends and my roommates doing things I did not feel good about. I somehow had weeks of difficult conversations with friends where I told them things were pre-retreat I would have been too afraid to speak about these things, too much aggression, passive-aggression, feeling jealous, and what I saw as unkind treatment of others. Also, I felt less defended and got a lot of feedback on where I was self-righteous, saw myself as a victim, and have been passive-aggressive. All in all a humbling experience to realise how blind I was to those things. I think because I found a home in my heart and was okay with feeling grief I stopped being afraid of doing things where I might lose some friendships as well as my self-image. So I was able to take bigger risks that I was not able to take before. I am more myself now. And I learned that doing the scary things was better for me and my friends in the long run. I was surprised by the understanding and encouragement I got from the majority of friends and strangers to be honest about what I think.</p>

<p>Overall this retreat experience and TWIM have profoundly shifted the trajectory of my life. I am very certain now that meditation is an extremely subtle but powerful practice to reduce my own and others’ suffering. During the retreat, many painful truths came up, and meeting them with patience and kindness was a great way to suffer less. A retreat can reduce dissociation to a degree that you might find yourself in a lot more perceived tension than pre-retreat.</p>

<p>May you find your path in your own time towards a home in your heart friend.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-by-chatgpt">TL;DR (by ChatGPT)</h2>

<p>This post details my transformative journey through a Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation (TWIM) retreat. It helped me break patterns of guilt and shame, uncover deep-seated traumas, and understand my depressive episodes and anxiety. The retreat fostered a sense of presence, acceptance, and expanded awareness in me. I gained insights into the mind-body connection and the power of love and kindness. Post-retreat, I experienced intense emotional release and self-realization, leading to significant life changes. I learned the importance of authenticity, honesty, and listening to my heart. The experience underscored the need for downtime after such an intense retreat for proper integration and adjustment. This retreat has been a life-changing journey, inspiring self-discovery and healing.</p>]]></content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="[&quot;meditation&quot;, &quot;jhanas&quot;, &quot;therapy&quot;, &quot;English&quot;]" /><category term="meditation" /><category term="jhanas" /><category term="therapy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been practicing tranquil wisdom insight meditation (TWIM), a powerful loving-kindness-based meditation system, for the past six months with a special focus on forgiveness practice.

I was drawn to the place by the charm and resonance of Rob Burbea’s teachings, which I listened to on <a href="https://dharmaseed.org">dharmaseed.org</a>. He was a resident teacher at Gaia House, and the retreat I attended was led by Catherine McGee and Yahel Avigur, both of whom were strongly influenced by his teachings. The retreat was a challenging but still surprisingly effortless and very rewarding experience.</p>

<p>At the end of the retreat, I went to London, which was quite a stark contrast to the quiet and peaceful scenery of the rural landscape around the retreat center oozing stillness and peacefulness. But even though it was harder to notice, I could still access the stillness within. It’s always there when I am sensitive enough to look for it. I also noticed colors more intensely and saw the positive and beautiful everywhere, all after five days of maybe six hours of daily meditation in a mix of walking and sitting meditation.</p>

<p class="caption"> The library and the entire place is truly beautiful and encourages you to become more present.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure now that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Technique">Alexander Technique</a> is basically a form of social body awareness meditation. You can get to the same place without a teacher and just by returning awareness to the whole body over and over. It’s also bringing students to expanded awareness and ultimately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism">nondual awareness</a>. Over the five days, I noticed my awareness expanding outside but also within my body. At some point, I could feel my hips during walking and generally my whole body. That then automatically improved my posture because my body would automatically untense as soon as awareness was in the tensed area. Also, the feeling after the retreat coming back to the city was similar to receiving Alexander Technique sessions and then walking through Berlin. Awareness is expanded, and I just look everywhere more curiously. There is joy in more small things, the neon light in front of the restaurant, the palm trees. The small becomes big and magical. So there’s more joy in the day.</p>

<p>My main takeaway was that I realized I could still meditate with less effort. Just holding the intention of whatever the goal of the meditation is lightly is enough. Willpower, at the point I am at, is of no more value. And I can notice the effort level in my breath. The more effort I put into meditation (or anything else, for that matter), the more turbulent my breath feels. When there is no effort, the breath feels like a laminar flow without any resistance and is barely audible. I realized that in the big meditation hall, when my breath was significantly more audible, that I was still efforting way more than needed, even when breathing out. But breathing out requires no effort. Doing nothing, the exhale just happens. With this more light way of meditating, I am more sensitive, and I can still work with upcoming dullness or boredom. Instead of using effort, I use the gentle but firm intention of returning to my goal of meditation and addressing whatever concern with acceptance and love.</p>

<p>Another thing I loved about the retreat was Catherine McGee’s charisma in person, which really stood out. She radiated a loving softness with a very confident and strong core. Something I have not seen in a person I met in person before. Some meditation teachers come off as loving but maybe somehow in an unbalanced soft way. She embodied what she spoke of and also explicitly pointed out some things I was missing in many meditation instructions. For example, her approach is very body-centered. So starting off with a shake session and just patting down your own body.</p>

<p>Another new idea I got from the retreat was in a talk by Catherine McGee, who explained how emptiness can help you be sensitive without becoming overwhelmed. I always struggled with meditation making me overly sensitive and wondered how I could cope with it in the real world. McGee pointed out that emptiness is not a goal in itself but rather a tool that can help you navigate the world while being sensitive.

<p>Another valuable insight McGee shared was that having attention in your belly can help you stay grounded. This point resonated with me and helped me to cultivate more groundedness in my daily life.</p>

<p>After the retreat, I was able to access <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K5ypXyF3dY">Jhana</a> one and two, which was a significant accomplishment for me. I could access them two years ago and then lost the ability to access them. Basically I put in a lot of effort over two years to learn that I need to stop putting in so much effort if I want to access them. I found that by holding the intention of accessing Jhana gently and patiently, I could enter these states more easily. What I found most powerful was imagining a loving other in the second Jhana. It felt like having a real person hold space for my parts and difficult emotions. The after-effects were remarkable, with more equanimity and joy throughout the day. In the Jhanas, attention and awareness are like train tracks that won’t budge, which helped me bring awareness to body parts that needed healing. I want to use the Jhanas to do Internal Family Systems healing work on myself rather than starting insight practice. That seems healthier to me, first strengthen psychological health before I start deconstructing my ways of looking and perception.</p>

<p>I also attended an Alexander Technique workshop after the retreat, which helped me realize that I could put even less effort into accessing the Jhanas after noticing how it is easier to catch a ball if I just don’t use any effort and let my body do it perfectly. During the Alexander Technique class, I learned how attention and awareness work in social group dynamics and how they relate to power and status. When people see someone as high status, they give them attention, and that person then directs others’ attention and awareness. With meditation and Alexander Technique, the goal is to direct awareness and attention mostly to oneself, which gives you permission to go wherever you want. So it’s understandable why people want to have a career and high status, it feels more fun to be in expanded awareness in social settings. But what many people don’t know is with meditation or Alexander Technique you get the same feeling, but without having to rely on external factors to give you permission. What an amazing pitch for meditation that is huh.</p>

<p>In the Alexander Technique class, when the teacher opened the student’s awareness, I could feel the student seeming to command the room as an equal to the teacher. However, a pitfall of Alexander Technique is that this experience of expanded awareness may be tied to permission from the teacher more easily than with meditation. With meditation practice, the teacher is far removed, so you realize that you are giving yourself permission to expand your awareness. But a good Alexander Technique teacher should be aware of this and make sure you credit yourself for expanding your awareness.</p>

<p>Overall, attending a silent retreat and learning about Jhanas and Alexander Technique was a life-changing experience for me. I’m grateful for the insights and tools I gained, and I hope to continue integrating them into my daily life.</p>]]></content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="[&quot;meditation&quot;, &quot;jhanas&quot;, &quot;therapy&quot;, &quot;English&quot;]" /><category term="meditation" /><category term="jhanas" /><category term="therapy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, I went on my first silent retreat at Gaia House in Britain.

I commend you on your courage, deciding to look inwards, even if parts of you might be worried about what lurks in your subconscious. Looking inside and being really curious about yourself is an revolutionary act in todays world. And unlike a view of being curious and involved with yourself as narcissistic, it’s very different. Trying to control how you and others see yourself is narcissistic, based on deep fears. Being curious and open to see who you really are from a place of love is healing and will benefit not only yourself but everyone around you. Your relationship to the parts of yourself is how you relate to everyone else. No one can be more intimate and loving towards you than yourself. That is the threshold of how much you can let in from others. And that threshold can be infinitely larger than you imagine right now.</p>

<p>In June of 2022, during a trip to the US, I worked with a therapist that completely changed my view of how much positive change is possible with a great therapist. Working with this therapist was as psychoactive as the psychedelic experiences I had, only that these changes in how I perceived me and the world stayed permanently. This therapist would just sit in front of me and ask me to scan my body. On the first day, my awareness of my body was strong as never before. I could notice when I would dissociate and the room would feel bigger. 
I would notice when a fear in me arose that projected that the therapist might hit me. All that was a level of awareness I had never had access to before. I noticed how I used humor to distract from fear. I cried in session three. After every appointment, I felt hopeful and joyful as never before. My mind got quiet, and I could enjoy just sitting in the park and watching the birds. Something I would have never done before. All of this within a week of three hours of daily therapy. Even when you discount that, before, I did half a year of weekly behavior therapy and never experienced such fundamental shifts in well-being. I never left the appointments feeling joy and hope. That new therapy experience made me realize that before, I was afraid of the therapy appointments because the therapist was afraid of my emotions. I only cried once with the previous therapist within half a year because she subconsciously communicated that she couldn’t hold my sadness.</p>

<p>On the other hand, with the therapist from the US, I noticed that opening up so many things so quickly was also destabilizing because when I moved back to Berlin, I now needed to continue without her presence. That was also due to losing trust because she had a weak spot that she could not address when I raised it. So what makes a great therapist? Here is my answer in the hope that it may inspire you to find yours. Overall it seems that the therapist can only raise you to their own level of awareness, emotional resiliency, and healing:</p>

<p>First, what is the goal of therapy? It’s learning to become aware of parts of your mind that you are hiding from yourself. It’s to learn to love the parts of yourself that you disown. It’s learning to become more embodied or embodied at all. It’s learning to feel safe in your body. It’s learning to notice how feeling relates to body sensations. It’s learning to let the emotions move through you rather than fully identifying with them. It’s learning to love all of your emotional experiences, especially the difficult ones. It’s learning to have boundaries. It’s understanding who you are and stopping wanting to change. It’s learning to know that you are already perfect. It’s learning that whatever you dislike about yourself is a natural, human reaction to your life experience. First I thought that crying often is a sign of a good therapist, but then some people, like me, have parts blocking crying at times.</p>

<p><b><em>A simple heuristic for how good the therapist is: How often do you notice shifts in how you relate to yourself and others after your sessions? And how much do you feel like you are responsible for your progress?</em></b></p>

<!--more-->

<p>All of those things can show up in very obvious or subtle ways. If you have a history of trauma, your first instinct is likely to doubt yourself. Actually, from my experience, your body will likely know pretty well what’s going on. If you avoid going to your appointments, e.g., by being late, and you don’t feel better afterward or, even worse, your body is telling you something.</p>

<p><strong>So what will a great therapist do to support you in that?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>never judges you</li>
  <li>always on your side</li>
  <li>they can sit with your sadness, and you can cry around them. But, if you never cry, you are most likely picking up on them, not being okay with your sadness.</li>
  <li>they want to work with you long-term</li>
  <li>they do not worry about you</li>
  <li>they are open to your feedback, and your suggestions (let’s walk outside, I want to go outside for a break)</li>
  <li>they are stable in their emotions</li>
  <li>they can hold your gaze for a long time without hardness</li>
  <li>they are gentle and know that slower is faster with trauma</li>
  <li>is aware of transference and will work with it, making you feel it’s safe to discuss how you feel towards them. E.g., you project your mother onto your therapist and feel like she might be disappointed about something you said, but you feel safe to tell your therapist, and they don’t feel threatened in their identity but rather work with that.</li>
  <li>they mainly help you to notice things in your body and mind</li>
  <li>they point you to yourself a lot; they are humble and curious. So your progress will feel like it’s all your work.</li>
  <li>they create a relationship where you feel like an equal</li>
  <li>they ooze a nonjudgemental ness and openness</li>
  <li>they will teach you techniques to regulate your nervous system</li>
  <li>they know about dissociation and can notice when you dissociate and then do exercises with you to regulate your nervous system</li>
  <li>they don’t want you to change</li>
  <li>they are more curious about you than you are yourself</li>
  <li>if you are chronically late, see that as a sign that parts of you are afraid of the therapy appointment and address that directly</li>
  <li>they know and have experience with meditation practice</li>
  <li>they will not just talk with you; they will use hypnosis, exercises, embodiment, and pauses to allow you to get out of your head into your body and emotions.</li>
  <li>they will let you have your emotions and not interfere with that</li>
  <li>they will do boundary work with you; they will train you to say no and feel your inner boundaries</li>
  <li>they are aware of how deep the impact of trauma goes, they will be open to you asking to leave the room, going for a walk outside, asking for shaking your body alone in the room, etc., to feel safe</li>
  <li>if they are insanely great, they will even suggest those things above to you when they notice you are triggered and dissociating</li>
  <li>they learn from you and want to learn from you</li>
  <li>they are creative and think for themselves; they don’t follow strict rules but rather experiment with what works</li>
  <li>their main agenda is for you to become more you</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What will a well-intentioned but not great therapist do to keep you stuck?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>think they know what you need better than yourself, and you might start believing them at some point.</li>
  <li>Can’t deal with big emotions; they will subtly signal that they are uncomfortable with what you share or you are being emotional. E.g., crossing their arms, slightly tensing their eyes when you become emotional or talk about a problematic experience. You might even feel you are a burden or manipulative because you subconsciously sense that they are afraid of your emotions (it’s called countertransference).</li>
  <li>they create a relationship where you feel they have authority</li>
  <li>they will worry about you</li>
  <li>they want you to change and want your approval</li>
  <li>see drug use as a problem without being curious about the underlying pain</li>
  <li>they will only talk about emotions to avoid emotions</li>
  <li>they will try to make you feel better</li>
  <li>they think that just experiencing the pain is healing when actually the amount of pain felt must be met with an equal amount of love and patience. Anything else is just reexperiencing trauma.</li>
  <li>strictly follow the rules and guidelines</li>
  <li>promises you quick solutions and fixes</li>
  <li>they want you to become like someone they imagine</li>
</ul>

<p>May your heart be filled with love for all your parts, friend. May you have a safe journey inside and through this mystical adventure of life.</p>]]></content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="[&quot;trauma&quot;, &quot;therapy&quot;, &quot;English&quot;]" /><category term="trauma" /><category term="therapy" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[You have decided that you want to get serious about loving all of you and want to start working with a therapist or changing from one you are not quite sure about.

This movie and its reception hold the key to understanding a lot of human behavior and functioning around dissociation, trauma, and human sexuality. It’s a great example of how mindful awareness and investigation help to understand something that possibly millions of humans who watched the movie did not fully piece together. I invite you to watch the film before reading the text.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><em>Please note: This text explores sexual abuse.</em></p>

<p>A quick summary of the movie is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
Nothing else has ever looked or felt like director René Laloux s animated marvel Fantastic Planet, a politically minded and visually inventive work of science fiction. The film is set on a distant planet called Ygam, where enslaved humans (Oms) are the playthings of giant blue natives (Draags). After Terr, kept as a pet since infancy, escapes from his gigantic child captor, he is swept up by a band of radical fellow Oms who resist the Draags oppression and violence. With its eerie, coolly surreal cutout animation by Roland Topor; brilliant psychedelic jazz score by Alain Goraguer; and wondrous creatures and landscapes, this Cannes-awarded 1973 counterculture classic is a perennially compelling statement against conformity and violence.
</blockquote>

<p>But let’s dive into what it depicts and the meaning behind it. In the beginning, it introduces us to the blue giants that are the masters of the little human that is still a baby at this point in the plot.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-7LuNSHlPco?clip=UgkxrF89rMfSpZ3cy93hNBsv8uWE2h6eSQ-G&amp;clipt=EKrhGhjKgB4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>In the context of the rest of the movie, this meditation refers to having sex while being dissociated. The eyes are turning red and the bubble floating above the blue aliens is a great visualization of dissociation, of disconnecting from the body. In the next scene, the relatively little human is encountering something in his host family:</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrJMgm6dBHA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>This key scene of the movie depicts sexual child abuse in a very detached and ingeniously subtle form. I know this might seem like a far-fetched claim. First of all, there are some details later in the movie that makes this interpretation obvious, and as well if you closely pay attention to what is happening, you can see this. The trick is not to interpret the scene literally and start to see and be aware of the meaning behind what is directly happening. You have to loosen your awareness and connect with the body to see this. Let’s take it slowly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fantastic-planet-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption"> The human child shows up at the beginning of this movie scene. The background seems alien, but it does not take much fantasy to see that these shapes resemble penises.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fantastic-planet-2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption">The child then sees a group of male aliens, and they start to close their eyes, dissociate, and disconnect. A black tentacle makes contact with their bodies, and the music implies pleasure.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fantastic-planet-3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption">The group of male aliens lose their boundaries, and their bodies merge.</p>
<p><img src="/images/fantastic-planet-4.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption">The small child is shocked, almost ashamed to have witnessed this.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrJMgm6dBHA?clip=UgkxifcIE2rbUgYZ1-aoyU57FX4rcf-id5is&amp;clipt=EI-KBRjX_gY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>When the men are caught, they just stop their act suddenly and pretend that nothing happened.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fantastic-planet-6.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption">The small child runs under a rain cloud. That represents fear and also grief; the rain is a detached depiction of tears.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fantastic-planet-7.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption">Notice how the child at the end of that rain scene, after running away in desperation smiles. It just puts on a good face.</p>

<p>The child character says the telling words.</p>

<blockquote>
A drag week was equivalent to one of my years. I was just a live plaything who sometimes dared to rebel. 
</blockquote>

<p>When you read the reviews, discussions, and interpretations of the movie, it is astonishing how some people pick up on the movie being about how we should not hurt animals or how totalitarian regimes are evil. No one seems to see the most obvious here. It’s a story about how children growing up in abusive homes are powerless and at the mercy of their parents. With abusive parents, in the worst case, sexually abusive parents, their children are prisoners of giant aliens that they need to please, and they try to rebel, but their power is almost none compared to their parents. This movie is about how vulnerable children are. Something that not many that reviewed the movie seemed to have picked up on.</p>

<p>The next scene is one where my hunch about this being about child sexual abuse got very certain:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-7LuNSHlPco?clip=UgkxZEPvXWcE3Oy_P0ritkFNJpnMrJbb6x3w&amp;clipt=ENChXRiw9mA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Do you remember the adult aliens’ dissociation meditation? Well, now here the movie explains that it was time for the children to be initiated to this as well. Now, what is sexual here? Again it’s so subtlely depicted that you need to loosen your awareness and become curious about the plants. In the movie reviews, many viewers mention that they found the bizarre plants particularly interesting. Well, if you look at them closely in this clip of the child meditation, you can make a stunning observation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fantastic-planet-8.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption">Notice what these plants might point to in a sexual context. Without viewing these scenes through that way of looking, it's easy to miss this. The entire movie has a sexual undertone to activate this consciously and subconsciously. But let's put some more attention in here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fantastic-planet-9.png" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption">Maybe you did see it. These plants are pointing to anal and vaginal penetration. Together with the floating children, this scene also seems to be depicting sexual child abuse. The movie makes the allusions in such a distanced and relatively subtle way that I feel it's unclear if the movie makers were themselves fully aware of what they were writing and drawing.</p>

<p>After this and some more background story, the now adolescent human manages to escape his prison and flees. Not without encountering yet another pointer to the sexual undercurrent of this movie. I think no explanation is needed for this one:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-7LuNSHlPco?clip=Ugkxo20SXqDo2w4QI4hD9Y8MPlu7EIIllrRU&amp;clipt=EMzhZBjLzGU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>After fleeing, our adolescent main protagonist encounters a group of undomesticated wild humans that live in a park. There he observes their mating ritual. Symbolically it begins with them receiving some magical stones that make them glow. Also, they receive that glow while they walk over the dead skull of one of the blue aliens. This one is not entirely obvious, but it seems to me that healing of sexuality is depicted here. The humans in this sequence overcome their childhood abuse by symbolically climbing over the dead abuser and then engaging in adult, consensual sexuality.</p>

<p>At the movie’s end, the meaning of the meditation is revealed to be sexuality, and intercourse. The humans discover this, allowing them to force the blue aliens to give them their own planet and live without hate.</p>

<p>The movie has many other layers of meaning, but I focused on childhood sexual abuse because this side of the movie is not mentioned by any review or comment. So given the above, I hope to have shown that this movie is an ingeniously subtle and covert depiction of child sexual abuse. The film ties this to dissociation, and disembodiment. But it also has a message of the possibility of healing your sexuality despite the abuse. Now when you read the movie reviews and comments, this is where it gets really interesting. First, some of the words under the entire length <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7LuNSHlPco">movie on youtube</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
I absolutely love this movie. I wish sci Fi was artistic like this, just pure creativity. It isn't like anything I ever seen, this movie actually is a inspiration in my artwork, still gotta practice but it's my main inspiration. It's so, random but it's not random? If that makes sense, it's a wonderful movie.
</blockquote>

<p>This commenter is pointing out how their subconscious is picking up on certain meanings without it landing fully in awareness.</p>

<blockquote>
My mom saw this movie in 1978ish at drive-in in Denver CO, I just watched it with her. She's in her 60s now, and she just kept saying  "Wow...Wow!".
</blockquote>

<p>This movie activates hidden away parts that might have experienced sexual abuse, which would explain these strong reactions. Another set of comments that stands out is comments that point out that the commenter saw the movie as a kid and was scared and fascinated at the same time:</p>

<blockquote>
I watched this when i was five I loved it so much this is so nostalgic
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Yall talking about how great this is, honestly traumatized by seeing it as a kid
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I can only be attracted to people who like this movie
</blockquote>

<p>The comments under the trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgCxCZNkQ9E">on youtube</a> also give room for thought given the insights from above:</p>

<blockquote>
I had vague memories of this film growing up, that would just pop into my head out of nowhere, or in my dreams a few times a year. I think I may have watched it when I was very young, and it just stuck. Until today, I always thought it was just a weird reoccurring dream. Pretty crazy that I just happened to stumble upon the trailer. I never even knew it was an actual movie.
</blockquote>

<p>This weird recurring dream might be this commenter expressing how deep in his subconscious certain traumatized parts of the mind were supressed.</p>

<blockquote>
For anyone under the age of 5 this is a horror movie. Speaking from experience, those cold red eyes peer into my soul every night still.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
My god, this film is giving me emotions I can't even describe. I feel like I wanna a cry and curl up into a ball, terrified and amazed by the sheer beauty of the art, all the while giving me a type of anxiety I've never felt before
</blockquote>

<p>This might be someone describing how this movie activates buried memories of their own abuse. But they do not have it fully in their awareness and are therefore left with a lot of confusion about this.</p>

<blockquote>
I remembered when I was like 8 years old (that was in the 90's) and watched this film on TV all alone in the hall in the middle of the night. In that moment, it really seemed "fascinating" to me... yeah, also like... disturbing (lacking a better word) and ended with a feeling of emptiness... I don't know how to explain it... I'm happy to finally know the title of this film.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
This cartoon struck me like a ton of bricks when I was a kid.  The art style is so much like old scientific illustrations.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when I was maybe 4. It scarred me in ways I can't even explain and it's only when I actually saw it as an adult that I was able to make sense of what I had seen. 

This is not a kids movie.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Really awesome movie to watch on acid. Just not something you'd want to watch if you never watched a movie on acid before. This was the 3rd movie I ever saw on acid. (1st was yellow submarine movie by the beatles, 2nd was the wall movie by pink floyd.) It's mostly mesmerizing &amp; serene. It has it's share of tense moments too, but  well worth it in the end. It really helped me learn to not give up on things so easily. Even when everything seem utterly hopeless.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I watched this movie when i was very kid, but I'll never forget it, a masterpiece...a dream telling, through dream languages, about reality ! 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I remember seeing this movie for some reason when I was a kid and it totally synced into my mind. I don’t remember going to see it in a movie theater I think it was actual TV back in the 70s. I don’t think that ever shows something like that where kids could see it. It’s probably created some really far out nightmares
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
This movie is so brilliant. I'm glad I watched it again. It freaked me out when I was little.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Amazing movie. A friend of mine told me to get ready for some "disturbing shizzz", but that was not the case. The whole time I felt like this was the work of something from outer space, as if someone who's living this reality couldn't have come up with this. It had a blend of innocence and maturity, painting human life as primal as possible. Loved it. I was also high as shit.e.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
i've seen this madness last night in a bar. I just had the image without sound and i couldn't stop watching. Simply AMAZING
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I saw this as a child 
It made me scared of the world
Now that I am older I found out it was true!
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
My parents took me to see this in the theater in 1973. I was 10. It traumatized me.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I remember my father showing me this movie when I was 7 years old and ending up semi-traumatised
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
This didn't scare me when I was young (about 8) and came across it when I was watching t.v., but now. It mortifies me. It REALLY freaks me out. I don't think I could ever watch it again. That fascinates me. I was so fearless as a child, but now, just the thought of watching this scares the hell out of me.
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe this is not the movie this commenter is scared about, but their own experience this movie is pointing towards.</p>

<blockquote>
There's something disturbing about this movie,but i cant get it out of my head.Genius
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Somehow, I can't shake off the impression this was real in some way.
</blockquote>

<p>This comment is truly amazing. It could be read as this person being somehow aware that this movie is pointing to their own experience of sexual abuse. But it is buried so deeply that they can not bring it into their awareness. Reading all the comments and making sense of them given this movie’s hidden meaning, we can speculate that these comments might point to the fact that, first of all, there are many people who have experienced sexual abuse that this movie resonates. Then also, the comments show how the human mind is very good at hiding this. The comments describe emotional experiences or point to how the movie traumatised or scared them. But to me, it seems likely that for many commenters, the movie is just pointing to their own experience, which is where these feelings come from. Then they watch the movie and resonate strongly, but without full awareness of what is going on. This, to me, seems to be best explained by trauma and dissociation. The memories are split off and buried deep inside the mind. When subtly triggered, as this movie does very well, these parts deep inside resonate. Because they are still very much suppressed, the viewers can’t make sense of the movie. It seems alien and weird and does not make sense. Yet they are captivated and in trance. All of this, to me, is an amazing insight how subtle and hidden signals are picked up on by the mind without coming fully into awareness. It’s influencing humans, captivating them, but they do not realize what is happening. It’s like they are not actually a single solid self. But they actually have hidden away parts that they can only faintly hear in the distance, so they don’t understand what they are communicating. I invite you to watch the movie and read through some reviews by film critics on Amazon, and comments on Youtube and try to make sense of this phenomenon. It’s eery how many people seem to miss this, almost as if they are prevented from seeing the child sexual abuse aspect of this film which has been around since the 70s. It shows how widespread this tragic phenomenon is and how much suppression the mind is capable of. This is how the mind works. We as humans are not these solid, monolithic selves. Especially when there is trauma, parts get split off, causing confusion. But just looking closely at this movie and its reception, we can see how normal this is. This also is an invitation to ponder and wonder more deeply, what are the things you are picking up on that draw in your interest, what people are picking up on beyond the obvious. Assuming people are truthful, and their minds sometimes or often strongly filter what they can be aware of. If you look closely and with curiosity there are a lot of surprising answers.</p>

<p>I’m grateful for the openness of the internet that allows such peeks into so many different human minds. I’m grateful for this movie and the recommendation by my friend.</p>

<p>May you all find curiosity and wonder in your confusion. May you all move towards healing.</p>]]></content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="[&quot;trauma&quot;, &quot;English&quot;]" /><category term="trauma" /><category term="movie" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A friend recommended me the old sci-fi classic Fantastic Planet (link to the whole movie).

<h2>Laser-Cut Foamcore for Fast Assembly</h2>
<section>
<img src="/images/portfolio/projects/csm_Figure_1_0f047a8bef.png" alt="HingeCore main image" />
</section>
<section>
<h3>Overview</h3>
HingeCore introduces a novel laser-cutting approach utilizing foamcore to create 3D structures with finger hinges for fast and glue-free assembly. This method supports the creation of robust, aesthetic, and functional models, ranging from furniture to art objects.

HingeCoreMaker is the accompanying software tool, seamlessly integrating with 3D modeling platforms to automate the conversion of 3D designs into 2D laser-cutting layouts, optimizing for precision and efficiency.

<p>
<ul>
<li>Finger hinges allow quick folding and assembly without the need for adhesives or tabs, reducing assembly time by 2.9x compared to traditional methods.</li>
<li>HingeCore models are highly durable, withstanding significant loads (e.g., 62kg with 5mm foamcore).</li>
<li>The generated layouts leverage three cut types (full, half-way, and crease) for optimized assembly.</li>
</ul>

This makes sense and serves society as a whole; you need to do abstract thinking detached from emotions to find objective truth, flaws in your or others’ thinking, logic errors in your computer code. If you do study computer science, the goal of your computer science institute and professors is usually primarily to teach and train this intellectual mind, this abstract and logical thinking. That’s what makes you a computer scientist after all. I came to realize after a couple of years of studying computer sciences that all the lectures, exercises, research I was spending most of my waking time on were training a very narrow part of my human mind. My human experience relies on a much broader repertoire of modes of thinking and parts of my mind in everyday life. You have emotions, empathy, fear, wants, and needs expressed in the non-intellectual and non-abstract subconscious parts of the mind. These things make up the majority of experiencing being alive. But studying computer science focused me on a tiny part of my human mind, the abstract, intellectual, logical thinking. I was trained by spending and understanding this mode of thinking during my studies. It’s interesting to think about what effect this has on my mind if I spend so much time on a part of my mind that has so little to do with everyday human experience and satisfaction.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This is highly speculative, but let’s ask how this circumstance could impact diversity in computer science? And more important how could we then increase diversity in computer science? I refer to diversity in a broad sense, socio-economic, gender, nationality, ethnicity. From my experience, it’s fair to say that computer science has an above-average presence of neurodivergent humans, introverts, and a lack of social skills. This can go two ways; on the one hand, I have experienced environments of non-judgment, where nerds just nerd out and really do not care about social norms and therefore also create an inclusive environment, e.g., I’m thinking of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress">Chaos Communication Congress</a> here. There you can see a lot of neurodivergence, cross-dressers, trans-humans walking the halls, and also a sense of everyone just being very open and friendly and helpful in ways I haven’t come across elsewhere. For example, when you are tearing something down at the end of the congress, random nerds will show up and offer to help you. The other way this nerdiness can swing is an environment where a lack of self-awareness, empathy, and ego comes together and creates an unempathetic, competitive, and cold climate. There can be dynamics of everyone trying to outsmart everyone else in a hostile instead of humble and caring manner. This is likely to make diverse people, who might identify with being in a weaker minority already, reconsider getting into such an environment. For example, I witnessed male nerds being irritated and, consequently, hurtful or demeaning towards women. They saw them primarily as women and as fellow human second. In conclusion, the question is how to leverage nerdiness to tip the scale towards the first way of the inclusive and non-judgemental environment?</p>

<p>A couple of goals come to mind that in my current understanding could increase diversity in computer science:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Promote the values of humbleness, support, collaboration.</li>
  <li>Increase self-awareness and using the emotional mind and less lone wolf attitude.</li>
  <li>Help everyone to decrease their ego and increase a sense of empathy towards others.</li>
  <li>Support of otherness, questioning, and counter-culture.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now the follow-up question is how to get closer to these goals in academic institutions that teach computer science?</p>

<ol>
  <li>For group exercises, add tutors or coaches with high empathy and let them support the team building and relating in the groups. Tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_contact">eye-gazing</a>, talking about how you make each other feel, <a href="http://dramaclassnow.com/?tag=trust-exercises">trust-building</a> exercises used in theater and improv classes.</li>
  <li>Make emotional development a first-class citizen, support groups, and classes where understanding and regulating one’s emotions is taught. These should be fun and difficult at the same time.</li>
  <li>Incorporate meditation teachers into the curriculum that teach basic mindfulness skills.</li>
  <li>Encourage professors and staff to mentor diverse students.</li>

Ethics is about the principled resolution of conflicts of interest between autonomous agents under conditions of shared purpose when playing long games. <a href="https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1200189702919225344?s=20">[1]</a> With this in mind, it is crucial to model incentives and their consequences for systems to evaluate ethics. On the most general level, we can take the goal of avoiding suffering as the shared purpose of all humans on earth. Additionally, maintaining the global civilization might be another high-level goal. Technologists with the ability to create and change technological systems should do so ethically by considering these goals and projecting the impact of the system they create into the distant future. Making this difficult, the complexity of networks of human and non-human entities interacting through technology on a global scale has become overwhelming. Additionally, technology changes at such a fast pace that national and global elites cannot anticipate its full impact anymore, leading to increasing randomness in societies trajectories without anyone being able to formulate and implement a coherent plan projecting them into the future. Therefore it is even more critical that technologists evaluate the ethics and impacts of their actions, especially given the enormous leverage that computer technology offers.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A field that does evaluate the consequences of actions and systems and their incentives in a computational fashion is game theory, which considers the global and local outcomes, given that all actors act only on their local incentives. It allows analyzing games and creating rules for games such that desired outcomes are achieved. Climate change is a simple example of game theory and its relationship to ethics: Given a set of players, they can play two actions: polluting or not polluting. However, given that polluting is cheaper than not polluting, the optimal strategy for every player is to pollute. The problem is the incentive structure. Thus the concept of carbon footprint and shifting the responsibility of climate change to the individual is unethical since the incentives will be set up for everyone to keep polluting. Instead, a global entity needs to update the payout matrix of the players in such a way that the updated costs lead to behavior that optimizes for the global environmental costs.</p>

<p>Thinking through the consequences of technology systems on these goals in a long game is cumbersome. Therefore I propose a simplified framework to approximate the ethics of technological systems locally. It is based on the observation that a lot of the dark side of deploying computer technologies seems to be about it being used to control human behavior by offering short-term and shallow fulfillment of human needs and desires. Often technology is used to control humans, treating them more like machines instead of helping them to be more human. As a user, you could ask yourself: “Does this in the long term help me feel more alive and human?”. As a technologist, you could ask yourself: “Does this in the long term help users feel more alive and human?”. While this question is quite open for interpretation, I propose referring to the five hindrances mentioned in Buddhistic scripture that are said to hinder progress in meditation and daily life. Technology that does increase the strength of the five hindrances (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_hindrances">[2]</a>) in its users could be said to contribute to them feeling less alive and human in the long term:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sensory desire: seeking for pleasure through the five senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and physical feeling.</li>
  <li>Ill-will: feelings of hostility, resentment, hatred and bitterness.</li>
  <li>Sloth-and-torpor: half-hearted action with little or no effort or concentration.</li>
  <li>Restlessness-and-worry: the inability to calm the mind and focus one’s energy.</li>
  <li>Doubt: lack of conviction or trust in one’s abilities.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let us apply this framework to a few examples from the user side. As a first example, let us look at some features of the Instagram iOS app. When I want to search for something, I have to open the search screen (see image below), which offers a small search bar at the top and the rest of the screen filled with images and videos curated by an automatic recommender system. Does this usage of technology make me feel more alive and human? No, it mostly does not. First of all, this unwanted recommendation directly subverts my intent of wanting to search for something, which already is undermining me exercising my will. Second, to a large degree, the recommended content is superficial posts that are optimized for engagement. A picture of a beautiful woman with an inspiring caption will not boost my mood in the long term and is just a technological knock-off version of a physical world one-to-one human interaction that inspires me. Also, the asymmetry of the following concept makes for a less human experience compared to the real world. Since the recommended content is mostly by accounts with a larger following which optimize for engagement. Interacting with that account will entail receiving less attention than I put in due to the asymmetric situation when users with large followings interact with their followers. This example shows that the app contributes to increasing hindrances one, three, and four.</p>

<p>Another example is video calling, which is part of the Instagram app and many other apps. Video calling facilitates a symmetric, real-time communication channel between two or more users. Even though this mode of communication lacks the elements of touch, smell, body language, and high-resolution of physical world interactions, it makes up for this by keeping human interaction possible over large distances. Additionally, to hearing the voice with all its emotional subtleties, I can see the other person and their facial expressions approximating a physical world human interaction. Keeping in touch with friends I value and otherwise would only get to interact within the physical world a couple of times a year makes me feel more human and alive.</p>

<p>Let us look at 3D printing, a technology that allows volumetric printing of shapes from digital 3D models. This allows processing digital intangible 3D models into physical world objects that I can touch and use. Overall this makes me feel more human and alive. I can have an idea or look at someone else’s idea for a 3D model and then print it out and get a sense of the idea with much more senses than the current restriction to a 2D view on a screen.</p>

<p>There are technologies for which this framework is not sufficient for evaluation since they are too abstract and general to be evaluated personally. For example, Javascript can be used to create interactive Web apps that engage more and help me understand a machine learning algorithm by displaying a visual model I can step through, which feels livelier and more human than reading from a static book. Then also, Javascript can be used to surveil and record my usage of the Facebook site, which is used to maximize engagement leading to an inevitable race to the bottom of the brain stem. <a href="https://bigthink.com/high-culture/tristan-harris-the-attention-economy-a-race-to-the-bottom-of-the-brain-stem/">[3]</a> This ultimately engages me short-term, but long-term glues my attention to the screen, making me feel less alive and human.</p>]]></content><author><name>Marcus Ding</name></author><category term="[&quot;tech&quot;]" /><category term="tech" /><category term="ethics" /><category term="essay" /><category term="opinion" /><category term="english" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I subscribe to the notion that ethics is entirely rational and maps to game theory. Ethics is about the principled resolution of conflicts of interest between autonomous agents under conditions of shared purpose when playing long games. [1] With this in mind, it is crucial to model incentives and their consequences for systems to evaluate ethics. On the most general level, we can take the goal of avoiding suffering as the shared purpose of all humans on earth. Additionally, maintaining the global civilization might be another high-level goal. Technologists with the ability to create and change technological systems should do so ethically by considering these goals and projecting the impact of the system they create into the distant future. Making this difficult, the complexity of networks of human and non-human entities interacting through technology on a global scale has become overwhelming. Additionally, technology changes at such a fast pace that national and global elites cannot anticipate its full impact anymore, leading to increasing randomness in societies trajectories without anyone being able to formulate and implement a coherent plan projecting them into the future. Therefore it is even more critical that technologists evaluate the ethics and impacts of their actions, especially given the enormous leverage that computer technology offers.]]></summary></entry></feed>
